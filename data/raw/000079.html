S. Customs office; and heralded by ovations from writers, professors, and\ncritics on both sides of the Atlantic.<p>\n<p>\nThe novel\'s scandal-tinted history and its subject--the affair between a\nmiddle-aged sexual pervert and a twelve-year-old girl--inevitably conjure up\nexpectations of pornography. But there is not a single obscene term in\n<i>Lolita</i>, and <i>aficionados</i> of erotica are likely to find it a dud.\n<i>Lolita</i> blazes, however, with a perversity of a most original kind. For\nMr. Nabokov has distilled from his shocking material hundred-proof intellectual\nfarce.  His book is slightly reminiscent of Thomas Mann\'s <i>Confessions of\nFelix Krull</i>; but <i>Lolita</i> has a stronger charge of comic genius and is\nmore brilliantly written. Mr. Nabokov, a Russian <i>&eacute;migr&eacute;</i>\nnow working in his second tongue, has few living equals as a virtuoso in the\nhandling of the English language.<p>\n<p>\nA mock sententious foreword explains that the manuscript which follows is the\nconfession of one Humbert Humbert, who died in captivity in 1952 just before\nhis trial was due to start. Humbert introduces himself as a European of mixed\nstock who, at the age of twelve, "in a princedom by the sea," loved and lost a\n<i>petite fille fatale </i>named Annabel Leigh, and has thereafter remained in\nsexual bondage to "the perilous magic" of subteen sirens--he calls them\n"nymphets." There follows a sketch of his tortured career up to the time when,\nin his late thirties, he settles in a quiet New England town (an American uncle\nhas left him a legacy, and he dabbles in scholarship) under the same roof as a\nfatally seductive nymphet, Dolores Haze--a mixture of "tender dreamy\nchildishness and eerie vulgarity."  This "Lolita" is the daughter of his\nlandlady, whom he marries with murderous intent. But an accident eliminates\nMrs. Haze, and Humbert the Nympholept finds himself the guardian of his\ndarling, who, on their first night together, turns out to be utterly depraved\nand plays the role of seducer. Their weird affair--which carries them on a\nfrenzied motel-hopping trek across the American continent--is climaxed by\nLolita\'s escape with a playwright and Humbert\'s eventual revenge on his\nrival.<p>\n<p>\nWhat is one to make of <i>Lolita</i>? In a prickly postscript to the novel, Mr.\nNabokov dismisses this question as a problem dreamed up by "Teachers of\nLiterature": he rejects the satiric interpretations which critics have put upon\n<i>Lolita</i> and asserts, in effect, that it is simply a story he had to get\noff his chest. That all of this is too ingenuous by half is evident from the\nparodic style in which <i>Lolita</i> is written: a combination of pastiches of\nwell-known styles, spoofing pedantry, analysis of passion <i>&agrave; la\nfran&ccedil;ais</i>, Joycean word games, puns, and all kinds of verbal play.\nWild, fantastic, wonderfully imaginative, it is a style which parodies\neverything it touches. It surely justifies, at least in part, those critics who\nhave seen in <i>Lolita</i> a satire of the romantic novel, of "Old Europe" in\ncontact with "Young America," or of "chronic American adolescence and shabby\nmaterialism." But above all <i>Lolita</i> seems to me an assertion of the power\nof the comic spirit to wrest delight and truth from the most outlandish\nmaterials. It is one of the funniest serious novels I have ever read; and the\nvision of its abominable hero, who never deludes or excuses himself, brings\ninto grotesque relief the cant, the vulgarity, and the hypocritical conventions\nthat pervade the human comedy. <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<hr noshade size="1"><font size=1>\n<I>Copyright &copy; 1958 by Charles Rolo.
