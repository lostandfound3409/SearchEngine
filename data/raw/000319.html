Supergroup Queen have been one\nof rock\xe2\x80\x99s most successful, influential and popular bands \xe2\x80\x93 with total\nrecord sales of more than 300million. </p><p>Now, to mark the 30th\nanniversary this year of their first recorded live album, Live Killers,\nThe Mail on Sunday brings you another exclusive musical world first.</p><p>Inside\nyour copy of the paper this weekend you\xe2\x80\x99ll find a fantastic free CD\nfeaturing many of the original tracks from the Queen album fans often\ndescribe as their best ever.</p><p>Queen have never before allowed\ntheir music to be used in a collaboration with a newspaper, but founder\nmembers Brian May and Roger Taylor have worked with The Mail on Sunday\nto produce this very special and collectable album. </p><p>There are\nten full Queen tracks featuring hits such as Killer Queen, Don\xe2\x80\x99t Stop\nMe Now and, of course, the drum and guitar classic We Will Rock You.</p>\n<p>They are all sung by the band\xe2\x80\x99s flamboyant and much-loved frontman,\nFreddie Mercury \xe2\x80\x93 the iconic superstar who tragically died in 1991. His\nextraordinary voice is complemented by May\xe2\x80\x99s exhilarating guitar,\nTaylor\xe2\x80\x99s storming drumming and John Deacon\xe2\x80\x99s rock-solid bass.</p>\n<div class="clear"> </div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  <img  src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/04/18/article-1169307-04823523000005DC-115_634x400.jpg" height="400" width="634" alt="True showmen: Freddie Mercury and Brian May at one of their live performances" class="blkBorder"/>\n<p class="imageCaption">True showmen: Freddie Mercury and Brian May at one of their live performances</p>\n<p>In a rare interview, Brian admits that the group were inspired from\nthe outset by the enthusiasm of their live audiences, who loved to clap\nand sing along to their songs.</p><p>\xe2\x80\x98We wrote for the common man,\xe2\x80\x99 he\nsays. \xe2\x80\x98About how we felt, our dreams and frustrations. That\xe2\x80\x99s why they\nidentified so much with us.</p><p>\xe2\x80\x98We are known for our anthem songs\nbut we didn\xe2\x80\x99t start out that way. In the beginning we wanted people to\nsit up and listen, because we thought we had something important to\nsay. But they wanted to participate. In the end we decided not to fight\nit, but rather to enjoy and even encourage it.\xe2\x80\x99</p><p>He recalls that the words and music for We Will Rock You came to him one morning after a particularly raucous concert.</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x98We played a gig at Bingley Hall near Birmingham. It was a popular\nvenue at the time. It was a big sweaty barn and that night it was\npacked with a particularly vocal crowd. They were definitely drowning\nus out with their enthusiasm.</p><p>\xe2\x80\x98I remember that even after we left the stage they didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop\nsinging \xe2\x80\x93 loudly. They sang You\xe2\x80\x99ll Never Walk Alone, which is very\nemotional. Quite a choking thing really. I certainly found it\ninspirational.</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x98Later that night back at our hotel I said to the\nothers, \xe2\x80\x9cThat was great. So what should we do to continue generating\nthat kind of energetic response?\xe2\x80\x9d </p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x98I woke up with the We Will Rock You lyrics in my head and had it written in about 10 minutes. </p>\n\n<div class="floatRHS">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  <img  src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/04/18/article-1169307-01EC3A8F0000044D-100_306x469.jpg" height="469" width="306" alt="Rock royalty: Queen in their heyday" class="blkBorder"/>\n<p class="imageCaption">Rock royalty: Queen in their heyday</p></div><p>\xe2\x80\x98I\nhave hundreds of versions of We Will Rock You on my iTunes. Hardly a\nday goes by without people asking if they can use the song, especially\nfor a military purpose. Which is somewhat ironic because I\xe2\x80\x99m really\nanti-war.\xe2\x80\x99</p><p>We Are The Champions, the power ballad written by\nMercury, is another that May says was built on audience response. \xe2\x80\x98We\nwanted to get the crowds waving and singing. It\xe2\x80\x99s very unifying and\npositive. People love it because it\xe2\x80\x99s so uplifting. </p><p>\xe2\x80\x98Although\nmuch of our music was created using multi-layered arrangements and\nvocal harmonies \xe2\x80\x93 which work especially well in the recording studio \xe2\x80\x93\nwe were into making our concerts musical events. </p><p>\xe2\x80\x98Live performances brought out the best in us, especially Freddie, who was such a showman.\xe2\x80\x99 </p><p>Unusually for a band, all four members have written songs that went to No1 in the charts. </p><p>This might have been a major factor in the longevity of their unity and friendship. </p><p>Brian\nsays: \xe2\x80\x98We all contributed songs to the albums and we all had successes.\nEven though most people think it was Freddie and I who wrote most of\nthe songs, everyone had an input in each track.</p><p>\xe2\x80\x98That was why we\ndecided in 1989, after our 10th album, that all future outputs would be\nunder the Queen banner and we would all be credited for each song.\xe2\x80\x99</p><p>Queen\xe2\x80\x99s\nmusic has survived and prospered for nearly 40 years and their songs\nhave been widely used in television commercials and at sporting events.</p><p>It\nis testimony to their enduring popularity that, according to The\nGuinness Book Of World Records, Queen albums have enjoyed 27 years on\nthe UK album charts \xe2\x80\x93 longer than any other musical act.</p><p>Their\n1985 Live Aid performance was voted the best live rock performance of\nall time in an industry poll. And their music has recently gained a new\ngeneration of fans through the hugely successful musical We Will Rock\nYou, featuring all their great hits woven into a story written by Ben\nElton. </p><p>The musical began in the West End in 2002 and has been\nplaying to packed houses around the world ever since. It has become the\nlongest-running musical at London\xe2\x80\x99s Dominion Theatre, overtaking the\nprevious record holder, Grease.</p><p>Four bonus Queen tracks, performed by the original cast of the musical, are included in our CD.</p><p>\xe2\x80\x98The\nsuccess of Rock You has been very satisfying for me personally,\xe2\x80\x99 Brian\nadds. \xe2\x80\x98From 1986 we had wanted to do a musical. Freddie was especially\nkeen, but the initial proposal to do a script of our story as Queen\nseemed too predictable and dreary, so we dropped it. </p><p>\xe2\x80\x98It was\nonly through my friendship with Ben Elton that the present show came\nabout. He suggested we create a futuristic plot on which to hang the\nsongs and it\xe2\x80\x99s worked very well. Every time I go into the Dominion\nTheatre the place is full, which is amazing, and the fact people come\nback time and again even more so.</p><p>\xe2\x80\x98The show\xe2\x80\x99s continued popularity lies in the fact that there is always something new to see. </p><p>\xe2\x80\x98With\neach company we have new singers and that helps to keep the event\nfresh. More than three million people have seen the London performance.\n</p><p>\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a great night out and, like our music, great escapism for all.\xe2\x80\x99</p><p>Queen and The Mail

Raphael\' and \'Rosie\'-- has been arrested for the murder of her deaf sister ... TMZ has learned.\nLaw enforcement sources tell TMZ, they received a call Monday from Blackstone saying there was a dead person and 3 dead dogs in her San Fernando Valley garage. Blackstone said the person killed herself, but when authorities arrived they thought the suicide note looked suspicious and believe it was written by Jill.\nThe victim, Wendy Blackstone, was 49 years old and lived in Studio City. We\'re told the body showed no outward signs of trauma and the Coroner is doing a toxicology report.  \nBlackstone has also produced \'Dr. Drew,\' \'The Real,\' \'Sharon Osbourne\' and various court shows.\nBlackstone was being held on $1 million bail. She was released late Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\nRead more: http://www.tmz.com/2015/03/18/jill-blackstone-murder-sister-jersey-shore-jerry-springer/#ixzz3UnHWzJca\nSome users are nic" width="154" height="115" />\n                        <span class="wocc bdrcc">EXCLUSIVE: \'She was a very nice person,\' says Jerry Springer...</span>\n                    </a>\n                </li>\n                <li class="new shallow-ac mini link-bogr6 linkro-wocc">\n                    <a href="/news/article-3001719/Multi-million-dollar-Hamptons-estate-owned-Hard-Rock-Cafe-magnate-Peter-Morton-completely-destroyed-fire.html">\n                        <img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/03/19/26CE6F5A00000578-0-image-a-9_1426784202873.jpg" alt="" width="154" height="115" />\n                        <span class="wocc bdrcc">Billionaire Hard Rock Cafe owner Peter Morton\'s Hamptons...</span>\n                    </a>\n                </li>\n                <li class="new shallow-ac mini link-bogr6 linkro-wocc">\n                    <a href="/news/article-3000407/Portraits-asylum-Harrowing-19th-century-photos-patients-notorious-institution-kept-SHACKLES-visibly-distressed.html">\n                        <img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/03/18/26C4401200000578-0-image-m-5_1426679714604.jpg" alt="" width="154" height="115" />\n                        <span class="wocc bdrcc">Faces from the asylum: Harrowing portraits of patients at...</span>\n                    </a>\n                </li>\n            </ul>\n            <div class="rotator-title wocc">\n              <h2>MOST READ NEWS</h2>\n                <div class="rotator-pages">\n                    <div class="rotator-prev"><i class="bg"></i><i class="ico"></i><a href="#" data-page="prev">Previous</a></div>\n                    <div class="rotator-next"><i class="bg"></i><i class="ico"></i><a href="#" data-page="next">Next</a></div>\n                    <ul>\n                        <li class="linkro-wocc"><a href="#" data-page="1">&#9679;</a></li>\n                        <li class="linkro-wocc"><a href="#" data-page="2">&#9679;</a></li>\n                        <li class="linkro-wocc"><a href="#" data-page="3">&#9679;</a></li>\n                    </ul>\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<script type="text/javascript">\n    DM.later(\'bundle\', function(){\n         DM.has(\'most-read-news\', \'Rotator\', {\n              pageSize: 4,\n              pageCount: 3.0\n         });\n    });\n</script>\n\n    \n    <script>\n    var rcShoutCache = \'{}\';\n    </script>\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    <script type="text/javascript">\n    DM.later(\'bundle\', function (){\n        DM.SHOUT = {};\n        DM.SHOUT.shoutChannels = \'\';\n    \tDM.SHOUT.isOldArticle = ;\n        DM.has("reader-comments", "ReaderComments", {\n            gplusClientId: \'746589970956-e10ciaf67a1id9ggu75ph3ds0sthn7j6.apps.googleusercontent.com\',\n            total: 0,\n            offset: 0,\n            allowNewComments:  false ,\n            moderated:  true \n        });\n    });\n    </script>\n\n    <div id="reader-comments" class="article-reader-comments article-id-1169307">\n        <a name="comments"></a>\n            <div class="rc-content">\n                \n                    <div class="rc-header link-ccow">\n                         \n                            <a id=\'addYourCommentButton\' href="#newcomment" rel="nofollow">\n                                <img src="http://f.dailymail.co.uk/i/furniture/comments/articles/btn_add-your-comment.png">\n                            </a>\n                        \n                        <div class="title-cont">\n                            <img src="http://f.dailymail.co.uk/i/furniture/comments/articles/icon_comments_74.png">\n                            <div>\n                                <h3>Comments (<span class="readerCommentsCount">0</span>)</h3>\n                                <p>\n                                \tShare what you think\n                                </p>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        \n                    </div>\n                \n                \n                    <p class="rc-title debate">No comments have so far been submitted.

TMZ has learned.\nLaw enforcement sources tell TMZ, they received a call Monday from Blackstone saying there was a dead person and 3 dead dogs in her San Fernando Valley garage. Blackstone said the person killed herself, but when authorities arrived they thought the suicide note looked suspicious and believe it was written by Jill.\nThe victim, Wendy Blackstone, was 49 years old and lived in Studio City. We\'re told the body showed no outward signs of trauma and the Coroner is doing a toxicology report.  \nBlackstone has also produced \'Dr. Drew,\' \'The Real,\' \'Sharon Osbourne\' and various court shows.\nBlackstone was being held on $1 million bail. She was released late Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\nRead more: http://www.tmz.com/2015/03/18/jill-blackstone-murder-sister-jersey-shore-jerry-springer/#ixzz3UnHWzJca\nSome users are nic" width="45" height="43" />\n              <span>EXCLUSIVE: \'She was a very nice person,\' says Jerry Springer of his producer, who could be REARRESTED in...</span>\n            </a>\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n        <ul>\n          <li class="more">\n            <a href="/news/headlines/index.html" class="bold"><span class="arrow-small-r"></span>MORE HEADLINES</a>\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </div>\n      <div id="p-1011-2" class="dm-tab-pane dm-tab-pane-hidden"\n            data-track-module="sm-442^automated_tabbed_headlines_thumbs_mostread">\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            <a href="/news/article-3002178/Michelle-Obama-towers-Japanese-Emperor-Akihito-smiles-awkwardly.html" class="bold">\n              <span class="arrow-small-r"> </span>\n            The height of etiquette: Michelle Obama towers over Japanese emperor as she stumbles in silver stilettos while attempting awkward curtsey\n            </a>\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <a href="/news/article-3001792/Woman-accused-cutting-baby-pregnant-womans-womb.html" class="">\n              <span class="arrow-small-r"> </span>\n            \'She cut me in the stomach, I\'m bleeding out\': Horrifying 911 call of seven-months pregnant woman \'who had her baby cut out of her in frenzied attack by woman who lured her with Craigslist ad\'\n            </a>\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <a href="/news/article-3001790/I-eat-breakfast-Man-eating-Waffle-House-confronts-diner-hit-throttled-woman-table.html" class="bold">\n              <span class="arrow-small-r"> </span>\n            Heroic moment Waffle House diner confronts man who was beating a woman at the next table\n            </a>\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <a href="/news/article-3000260/Starbucks-PR-fail-Twitter-mockery-causes-coffee-executive-delete-account-customers-say-NOT-want-talk-racism-ordering-coffee.html" class="">\n              <span class="arrow-small-r"> </span>\n            Starbucks hit by \'cascade of negativity\' after ordering staff to talk racism with customers: Vice President forced off Twitter as angry public turns on \'patronizing\' project&nbsp;\n            </a>\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <a href="/news/article-3001703/Another-mom-never-replaced-father-lost-Woman-raised-lesbian-moms-comes-against-gay-marriage.html" class="bold">\n              <span class="arrow-small-r"> </span>\n            \'Another mom could never have replaced the father I lost\': Woman raised by lesbian moms comes out against gay marriage\n            </a>\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <a href="/news/article-3000913/Dominatrix-Kim-Petro-details-lurid-encounter-Michael-Phelps-wore-women-s-panties.html" class="">\n              <span class="arrow-small-r"> </span>\n            \'Why not get paid\': Plus-sized dominatrix details \'lurid encounter with Michael Phelps in which he wore women\'s panties\'\n            </a>\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <a href="/news/article-3002756/Popular-personal-trainer-killed-freight-train-making-workout-video-YouTube-near-tracks.html" class="bold">\n              <span class="arrow-small-r"> </span>\n            Popular personal trainer killed by freight train while making workout video for YouTube near the tracks\n            </a>\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <a href="/news/article-3002147/They-shot-moved-Tourists-caught-Tunisian-museum-massacre-reveal-gunmen-slaughtered-indiscriminately-father-forced-watch-wife-child-killed.html" class="">\n              <span class="arrow-small-r"> </span>\n            Inside the Tunisian massacre museum: Terrifying images show dead \'ISIS\' gunmen and reveal full extent of carnage which killed 23 people -
