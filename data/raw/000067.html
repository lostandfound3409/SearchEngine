Catcher In The Rye </em>in 1951. It was originally published for adults but its themes of teenage angst and alienation saw it gain a new audience with adolescent readers. Written in a subjective style from the point of view of its protagonist and antihero Holden Caulfield, following his exact thought process. Holden Caulfield has since become an icon for teenage rebellion. Between 1961 and 1982, <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> was the most censored book in high schools and libraries in the United States. But it was also the second most taught book in American schools. In 2005, the novel was included on <em>Time Magazine\'s</em> list of the 100 best English language novels written since 1923.</p><div class="inline-content photo full">\n    <a href="/radionational/programs/booksandarts/the-catcher-in-the-rye-by-jd-salinger/4922430">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/image/4922430-4x3-700x525.jpg" alt="The Catcher in the Rye by JD Salinger [Mandel Ngan: AFP]" title="The Catcher in the Rye by JD Salinger [Mandel Ngan: AFP]" />\n</a><a href="/radionational/programs/booksandarts/the-catcher-in-the-rye-by-jd-salinger/4922430"><strong>Image:</strong>\n       The first edition cover of JD Salinger\'s 1951 novel <em>Catcher in The Rye</em> <span class="source">(Mandel Ngan: AFP)</span>\n      </a></div>\n<p>  </p></div>\n  <p>\n  <a class="ico ico-comment" href="#comments">Add comment</a>\n     </p>\n<div class="ct-social-share">\n  <ul>\n    <li><a class="ico ico-facebook" title="Post a link to this story via Facebook" href="http://facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/booksandarts/book-club-the-catcher-in-the-rye/4898654">Facebook</a></li>\n    <li><a class="ico ico-twitter" title="Post a link to this story via Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/home?status=American Classic: The Catcher In The Rye%20http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/booksandarts/book-club-the-catcher-in-the-rye/4898654&RadioNational">Twitter</a></li>\n    <li><a class="ico ico-delicious" title="Post a link to this story on Delicious" href="http://del.icio.us/post?v=2&url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/booksandarts/book-club-the-catcher-in-the-rye/4898654&title=American Classic: The Catcher In The Rye">Delicious</a></li>\n    <li><a class="ico ico-reddit" title="Post a link to this story on Reddit" href="http://reddit.com/submit?url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/booksandarts/book-club-the-catcher-in-the-rye/4898654&title=American Classic: The Catcher In The Rye">Reddit</a></li>\n    <li><a class="ico ico-digg" title="Digg this story" href="http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/booksandarts/book-club-the-catcher-in-the-rye/4898654">Digg</a></li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><a href="/radionational/" class="help" title="Find out more about social bookmarking">what are these?</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class="ct-guests">\n    <h2>Guests</h2>\n    <dl class="ico ico-person">\n    <dt>Robert  Thompson</dt>\n      <dd>Author, leading commentator on popular culture; heads the Bleier Centre for Television and Popular Culture, Syracuse University, New York.</dd>\n      </dl>\n    <dl class="ico ico-person">\n    <dt>Mary Delahunty</dt>\n      <dd>Australian writer, broadcaster, journalist and commentator</dd>\n      </dl>\n    <dl class="ico ico-person">\n    <dt>Stella McInnes</dt>\n      <dd>15-year-old Melbourne teenager</dd>\n      </dl>\n    </div>\n<div class="ct-credit">\n    <h2>Credits</h2>\n    <dl>\n    <dt class="ico ico-person">Producer</dt>\n      <dd>Linda Lopresti, international editor </dd>\n    <dt class="ico ico-person">Interviewer</dt>\n      <dd>Michael Cathcart </dd>\n    </dl>\n  </div>\n\n<div class="ct-comments" id="comments">\n\t<h2>Comments (28)</h2>\n    <p class="add-more"><a href="http://www2b.abc.net.au/tmb/View/NewMessage.aspx?b=304&amp;t=689&amp;tn=coremedia%3a%2f%2f%2fcap%2fcontent%2f4898654&amp;dm=1&amp;tpa=&amp;r=%2ftmb%2fView%2fMessage.aspx%3fb%3d304%26t%3d689%26a%3d0%26ps%3d50%26tpa%3d%26uto%3d1%26dm%3d4%26ci%3d0%26pd%3d1%26so%3dDateTime%26soa%3dTrue%26p%3d1%26p2%3d0">Add your comment</a></p>\n\t<ul>\n\t\n<li class="">\n\t<a id="m_ucMessageDisplay2193_m_anchMessageAnchor" name="m2193"></a>\n\t<h3>Tony M :</h3>\n\t<p class="date">11 Sep 2013 5:39:14pm</p>\n\t<p class="comment">I have to protest at the recorded promotion for this programme, in which Michael Cathcart refers to the novel as &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot;. Henry James didn\'t write &quot;Ambassadors&quot;; he wrote &quot;The Ambassadors&quot;. Charles Dickens didn\'t write &quot;Christmas Carol&quot;; he wrote &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. David Malouf didn\'t write &quot;Great World&quot;; he wrote &quot;The Great World&quot;. And JD Salinger didn\'t write &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot;; he wrote &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;, as the dustwrapper you\'ve used as an illustration shows clearly. Definite and indefinite articles in book titles are important, and their omission can completely change the meaning of a title or render it absurd.<br />And you might want to remove the errant apostrophe from your description of the programme - &quot;...it\'s themes of teenage angst and alienation...&quot;.  <br /></p>\n\t\n\t<p class="links">\n\t    <a href="http://www2b.abc.net.au/tmb/View/NewMessage.aspx?b=304&amp;t=689&amp;tn=&amp;dm=1&amp;m=2193&amp;tpa=&amp;r=%2ftmb%2fView%2fMessage.aspx%3fb%3d304%26t%3d689%26a%3d0%26ps%3d50%26tpa%3d%26uto%3d1%26dm%3d4%26ci%3d0%26pd%3d1%26so%3dDateTime%26soa%3dTrue%26p%3d1%26p2%3d0">Reply</a>\n\t    \n\t    <a href="http://www2b.abc.net.au/tmb/View/AlertModerator.aspx?b=304&amp;m=2193&amp;tpa=&amp;r=%2ftmb%2fView%2fMessage.aspx%3fb%3d304%26t%3d689%26a%3d0%26ps%3d50%26tpa%3d%26uto%3d1%26dm%3d4%26ci%3d0%26pd%3d1%26so%3dDateTime%26soa%3dTrue%26p%3d1%26p2%3d0">Alert moderator</a>\n\t</p>\n\t<ul>\n\t<ul>\n<li class="">\n\t<a id="m_ucMessageDisplay2193_m_ucMessageChildren_m_ucMessageDisplay2264_m_anchMessageAnchor" name="m2264"></a>\n\t<h3>Don :</h3>\n\t<p class="date">30 Sep 2013 8:46:45pm</p>\n\t<p class="comment">Conversely: Peter Carey didn\'t write \'The True History of the Kelly Gang\', but \'True History of the Kelly Gang\'&amp; was very insistent about the correct title.

Sad and tragic but true. My first reading was about age 17 and last was at age 63 and every reading was different - it could be a maturing thing or a current state of mind, but whatever, it is a gorgeous book with so many facets. I think for ages about how beautifully his words were place one after another.  Every word is delicious and has there ever been a character so beautifully and lovingly drawn? Of course, Holden would think we\'re a mob of wankers for even taking the time to discuss his miserable and aimless life, and if we were sitting in some bar sipping martinis with the jazz playing in the background, it would really top things off.  I love that old JD put this piece together then skulked off and pulled down the blinds. (His other couple of stories didn\'t do it for me.)  In case you\'re interested, my absolute favourite word in the book just has to be \'grools&amp;amp;quot; -describing the three girls in the bar who spurned him but were happy for him to pick up the tab for the drinks. In today\'s world of \'must know everything\' isn\'t it just great that here is one of the all-time best writers and he will always remain a mystery? <br />If ever you wanted to entice a young person to read, just chuck this on his/her bed. <br /> <br /></p>\n\t\n\t<p class="links">\n\t    <a href="http://www2b.abc.net.au/tmb/View/NewMessage.aspx?b=304&amp;t=689&amp;tn=&amp;dm=1&amp;m=2209&amp;tpa=&amp;r=%2ftmb%2fView%2fMessage.aspx%3fb%3d304%26t%3d689%26a%3d0%26ps%3d50%26tpa%3d%26uto%3d1%26dm%3d4%26ci%3d0%26pd%3d1%26so%3dDateTime%26soa%3dTrue%26p%3d1%26p2%3d0">Reply</a>\n\t    \n\t    <a href="http://www2b.abc.net.au/tmb/View/AlertModerator.aspx?b=304&amp;m=2209&amp;tpa=&amp;r=%2ftmb%2fView%2fMessage.aspx%3fb%3d304%26t%3d689%26a%3d0%26ps%3d50%26tpa%3d%26uto%3d1%26dm%3d4%26ci%3d0%26pd%3d1%26so%3dDateTime%26soa%3dTrue%26p%3d1%26p2%3d0">Alert moderator</a>\n\t</p>\n\t<ul>\n\t\n\t</ul>\n</li>\n\t\t    \n<li class="">\n\t<a id="m_ucMessageDisplay2212_m_anchMessageAnchor" name="m2212"></a>\n\t<h3>Aptitude Design :</h3>\n\t<p class="date">22 Sep 2013 1:01:59pm</p>\n\t<p class="comment">I agree with Tony M: use English, not Manglish, or Malbornish.

Holden\'s neatly described behaviour and attitudes all seemed to me to show him just helplessly emulating his father and unable to find himself.<br />The tantalising expectation which was almost fulfilled near the end of the book was that we would eventually meet the man whose neglect and undertone of abuse was responsible for Caulfield\'s psychopathy. But alas, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen, we were just left to speculate on what an unpleasant and revealing encounter it would have been.<br />In other words, I think this novel is a prophetic parable describing the degeneration of the \'American Dream\' which the father embodied and which Holden was reluctantly adopting, as a result of not having the spiritual and mental resilience to resist.</p>\n\t\n\t<p class="links">\n\t    <a href="http://www2b.abc.net.au/tmb/View/NewMessage.aspx?b=304&amp;t=689&amp;tn=&amp;dm=1&amp;m=2219&amp;tpa=&amp;r=%2ftmb%2fView%2fMessage.aspx%3fb%3d304%26t%3d689%26a%3d0%26ps%3d50%26tpa%3d%26uto%3d1%26dm%3d4%26ci%3d0%26pd%3d1%26so%3dDateTime%26soa%3dTrue%26p%3d1%26p2%3d0">Reply</a>\n\t    \n\t    <a href="http://www2b.abc.net.au/tmb/View/AlertModerator.aspx?b=304&amp;m=2219&amp;tpa=&amp;r=%2ftmb%2fView%2fMessage.aspx%3fb%3d304%26t%3d689%26a%3d0%26ps%3d50%26tpa%3d%26uto%3d1%26dm%3d4%26ci%3d0%26pd%3d1%26so%3dDateTime%26soa%3dTrue%26p%3d1%26p2%3d0">Alert moderator</a>\n\t</p>\n\t<ul>\n\t\n\t</ul>\n</li>\n\t\t    \n<li class="">\n\t<a id="m_ucMessageDisplay2225_m_anchMessageAnchor" name="m2225"></a>\n\t<h3>Darryl :</h3>\n\t<p class="date">26 Sep 2013 11:28:27am</p>\n\t<p class="comment">I have not read Catcher in decades, although I did read it more than once when in my late teens. The scene that resonated and has always stayed with me was when Holden got into the family home and woke his sister. Pheobe is the sage voice in this book, and all the more important because she is a child. When Holden explains his dream or vision, saving the children from the precipice they cannot see from within the field of rye - surely the most exceptional of adolescent visions, intentions and hopes in the history of modern fiction -  Pheobe succinctly puts her brothers\'s fantasy into real-life terms: \'Daddy\'s gonna kill you...\'</p>\n\t\n\t<p class="links">\n\t    <a href="http://www2b.abc.net.au/tmb/View/NewMessage.aspx?b=304&amp;t=689&amp;tn=&amp;dm=1&amp;m=2225&amp;tpa=&amp;r=%2ftmb%2fView%2fMessage.aspx%3fb%3d304%26t%3d689%26a%3d0%26ps%3d50%26tpa%3d%26uto%3d1%26dm%3d4%26ci%3d0%26pd%3d1%26so%3dDateTime%26soa%3dTrue%26p%3d1%26p2%3d0">Reply</a>\n\t    \n\t    <a href="http://www2b.abc.net.au/tmb/View/AlertModerator.aspx?b=304&amp;m=2225&amp;tpa=&amp;r=%2ftmb%2fView%2fMessage.aspx%3fb%3d304%26t%3d689%26a%3d0%26ps%3d50%26tpa%3d%26uto%3d1%26dm%3d4%26ci%3d0%26pd%3d1%26so%3dDateTime%26soa%3dTrue%26p%3d1%26p2%3d0">Alert moderator</a>\n\t</p>\n\t<ul>\n\t\n\t</ul>\n</li>\n\t\t    \n<li class="">\n\t<a id="m_ucMessageDisplay2230_m_anchMessageAnchor" name="m2230"></a>\n\t<h3>Doug :</h3>\n\t<p class="date">27 Sep 2013 8:04:32am</p>\n\t<p class="comment">I remember the fact that we studied The Catcher In The Rye when I was in Year 9 or Year 10 at high school in the 1970s, but not much else about the book, apart from that.   <br />The only clear memory that I have from the book is where Holden Caulfield was trying to break into a house.  He unrolls a sheet of plastic which is sticky (adhesive) on one side - like what we would describe today as &quot;contact&quot;. He places it over a window, completely covering the window glass pane, then he hits the glass and breaks the window. Instead of shattering into thousands of pieces, most of the glass stays glued to the sheet of adhesive plastic, so he lifts the sheet out of the way, then climbs through the window opening without cutting himself on broken glass. <br />I have forgotten almost everything else about the book, but that one bit of practical information has stayed with me since then, and I have often used it when I have needed to break windows or other sheets of glass in a safe (and non-criminal) manner. <br />At least, I think that is where I read about that glass-breaking description.  I just had a look at the summary on Wikipedia, and the glass-breaking incident was not mentioned.  Hopefully some of your literary experts will know if this incident is, indeed, in the book, or if I have got my school novels mixed up since the 1970s.  <br />Cheers. <br /> <br />Doug (MEd, PhD) <br />High School teacher (But NOT an English teacher) <br /></p>\n\t\n\t<p class="links">\n\t    <a href="http://www2b.abc.net.au/tmb/View/NewMessage.aspx?b=304&amp;t=689&amp;tn=&amp;dm=1&amp;m=2230&amp;tpa=&amp;r=%2ftmb%2fView%2fMessage.aspx%3fb%3d304%26t%3d689%26a%3d0%26ps%3d50%26tpa%3d%26uto%3d1%26dm%3d4%26ci%3d0%26pd%3d1%26so%3dDateTime%26soa%3dTrue%26p%3d1%26p2%3d0">Reply</a>\n\t    \n\t    <a href="http://www2b.abc.net.au/tmb/View/AlertModerator.aspx?b=304&amp;m=2230&amp;tpa=&amp;r=%2ftmb%2fView%2fMessage.aspx%3fb%3d304%26t%3d689%26a%3d0%26ps%3d50%26tpa%3d%26uto%3d1%26dm%3d4%26ci%3d0%26pd%3d1%26so%3dDateTime%26soa%3dTrue%26p%3d1%26p2%3d0">Alert moderator</a>\n\t</p>\n\t<ul>\n\t\n\t</ul>\n</li>\n\t\t    \n<li class="">\n\t<a id="m_ucMessageDisplay2231_m_anchMessageAnchor" name="m2231"></a>\n\t<h3>Kate Brooks :</h3>\n\t<p class="date">27 Sep 2013 10:21:39am</p>\n\t<p class="comment">The first time I read it was as a teen and I thought right on Holden, but was a bit concerned that he was not just expressing teenage angst but something different and far more damaging.

Has anyone mentioned the recent documentary and book on Salinger? I began to reread Catcher, which I hadn\'t read since the early 60s (by which time it must have been un-banned), laughing our loud on a Brisbane bus. But I had to stop to preserve my memories because, having seen the documentary, I now can\'t do anything but read it through the extraordinary sadness that pervades the film. One think I learned from the makers and commentators was that Salinger\'s war experience is an influence throughout his writing. He landed on DDay and fought his way through to the liberation of Paris, then was in counter-intelligence and one of the first people to enter Dachau. There\'s some amazing footage and a very few photographs, one of which is Salinger sitting at a makeshift table in the middle of army activities, writiing, and I think I\'m right that it was Catcher that he worked on and that kept him relatively sane, throughout the war - though he did indeed have a breakdown after more than 200 straight days of combat. <br />Thanks for the program.

The other\xe2\x80\x99s comments were wonderful really but in comparison they somehow did feel a little bit \xe2\x80\x9cphoney\xe2\x80\x9d.  On first reading the book after long hearing it mentioned by many, I was disappointed; and like Stellar I do not like Holden.  It reminded me too much of empty, apathetic, wasted years of high school where I learnt and did so little.   After high school I was lucky to stumble on the joy and fulfilment of a full engagement with life and people but there was no prospect of that kind of growth in Holden that I could see. <br />The book does reflect well the disaster that our high school system is for the creativity and inspiration of so many.   I think the problem with Holden is not that he is lazy, as Stellar put it, but that he has been poorly nurtured to be the engaged, joyfully thriving teenager that is all our birth potential; by family, community and probably as much as any by high school.   This is what I would have loved to hear Stellar comment on:  does she see peers going through the same; for those that aren\xe2\x80\x99t  is it due to better nurture along the way or a better high school structure perhaps?   Big questions for one so young perhaps but this is perhaps the utility, I am now beginning to think, the book, and such discussion could promote.  Catcher in the Rye reminds me of the ennui of Tolstoys early writings in \xe2\x80\x9cChildhood and Youth\xe2\x80\x9d;   He followed that with the brilliantly inspiring and life affirming  characters of \xe2\x80\x9cWar and Peace\xe2\x80\x9d and Levin and Kitty and others in \xe2\x80\x9cAnna Karenina\xe2\x80\x9d.

A book is vehicle that creates a kind of induced empathy to display some kind of meaning or narrative-it cannot stay between the flags as by definition we are all swimming existentially at a different  part of the \'beach\'. To me Holden is wonderfully portrayed as a real person with pluses and minuses, imperfect but struggling with unacknowledged  grief in a society which hides from emotion because it can be difficult. At times Holden avoids interaction as we all do  because it takes effort and is unpredictable but ultimately we learn that everything that with meaning involves emotion and therefore people</p>\n\t\n\t<p class="links">\n\t    <a href="http://www2b.abc.net.au/tmb/View/NewMessage.aspx?b=304&amp;t=689&amp;tn=&amp;dm=1&amp;m=2245&amp;tpa=&amp;r=%2ftmb%2fView%2fMessage.aspx%3fb%3d304%26t%3d689%26a%3d0%26ps%3d50%26tpa%3d%26uto%3d1%26dm%3d4%26ci%3d0%26pd%3d1%26so%3dDateTime%26soa%3dTrue%26p%3d1%26p2%3d0">Reply</a>\n\t    \n\t    <a href="http://www2b.abc.net.au/tmb/View/AlertModerator.aspx?b=304&amp;m=2245&amp;tpa=&amp;r=%2ftmb%2fView%2fMessage.aspx%3fb%3d304%26t%3d689%26a%3d0%26ps%3d50%26tpa%3d%26uto%3d1%26dm%3d4%26ci%3d0%26pd%3d1%26so%3dDateTime%26soa%3dTrue%26p%3d1%26p2%3d0">Alert moderator</a>\n\t</p>\n\t<ul>\n\t\n\t</ul>\n</li>\n\t\t    \n<li class="">\n\t<a id="m_ucMessageDisplay2248_m_anchMessageAnchor" name="m2248"></a>\n\t<h3>Cass :</h3>\n\t<p class="date">27 Sep 2013 9:33:58pm</p>\n\t<p class="comment">I was an exchange student in the mid 1960s in a small US town and The Catcher wasn\'t banned exactly, but the teachers strongly disapproved.

As outlined in the following quotation from Wiki, it precipitated legislation that eventually created the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).<br />While the USA is \xe2\x80\x9cthe land of opportunity\xe2\x80\x9d and a magnet attracting immigrants from third world countries it can still all these years after \xe2\x80\x9cThe Jungle\xe2\x80\x9d be a place of desperate poverty for the unsuccessful in their society.  A book definitely worth some discussion.<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jungle#Federal_response<br /><br />President Theodore Roosevelt had described Sinclair as a &quot;crackpot&quot; because of his socialist positions.[10] \xe2\x80\xa6 After reading The Jungle, Roosevelt agreed with some of Sinclair\'s conclusions. Roosevelt wrote, &quot;radical action must be taken to do away with the efforts of arrogant and selfish greed on the part of the capitalist.&quot;[12] He assigned the Labor Commissioner Charles P. Neill and social worker James Bronson Reynolds to go to Chicago to investigate some meat packing facilities.<br /><br />Learning about the visit, owners had their workers thoroughly clean the factories prior to the inspection, but Neill and Reynolds were still revolted by the conditions. Their oral report to Roosevelt supported much of what Sinclair portrayed in the novel, excepting the claim of workers falling into rendering vats.[13] Neill testified before Congress that the men had reported only &quot;such things as showed the necessity for legislation.&quot;[14] That year, the Bureau of Animal Industry issued a report rejecting Sinclair\'s most severe allegations, characterizing them as &quot;intentionally misleading and false,&quot; &quot;willful and deliberate misrepresentations of fact,&quot; and &quot;utter absurdity.&quot;[15]<br /><br />Roosevelt did not release the Neill-Reynolds Report for publication. His administration submitted it directly to Congress on June 4, 1906.[16] Public pressure led to the passage of the Meat Inspection Act and the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906; the latter established the Bureau of Chemistry (in 1930 renamed as the Food and Drug Administration.<br />(more) Continued interest<br />The book has been in print since 1906 and is considered a classic of American protest literature.<br />\tEnd of quote<br /> <br /></p>\n\t\n\t<p class="links">\n\t    <a href="http://www2b.abc.net.au/tmb/View/NewMessage.aspx?b=304&amp;t=689&amp;tn=&amp;dm=1&amp;m=2252&amp;tpa=&amp;r=%2ftmb%2fView%2fMessage.aspx%3fb%3d304%26t%3d689%26a%3d0%26ps%3d50%26tpa%3d%26uto%3d1%26dm%3d4%26ci%3d0%26pd%3d1%26so%3dDateTime%26soa%3dTrue%26p%3d1%26p2%3d0">Reply</a>\n\t    \n\t    <a href="http://www2b.abc.net.au/tmb/View/AlertModerator.aspx?b=304&amp;m=2252&amp;tpa=&amp;r=%2ftmb%2fView%2fMessage.aspx%3fb%3d304%26t%3d689%26a%3d0%26ps%3d50%26tpa%3d%26uto%3d1%26dm%3d4%26ci%3d0%26pd%3d1%26so%3dDateTime%26soa%3dTrue%26p%3d1%26p2%3d0">Alert moderator</a>\n\t</p>\n\t<ul>\n\t\n\t</ul>\n</li>\n\t\t    \n<li class="">\n\t<a id="m_ucMessageDisplay2253_m_anchMessageAnchor" name="m2253"></a>\n\t<h3>Leonie :</h3>\n\t<p class="date">28 Sep 2013 8:11:35pm</p>\n\t<p class="comment">I think anyone with a pinch of white middle class guilt within themselves, could perhaps dislike Holden Caulfield or the book.

At times  I was certainly worried about him. However, the more I read and learn from him, the more I feel that he was a young guy grappling with death/grief /trauma without much input or support from his family.  <br />The spectrum &amp; clarity of Holden\'s thoughts are so real to me. Hilarious, insightful, flippant, rude, critical, cynical, teenage, wise, sad, deeply empathetic. To me this character expresses a pre-adult-like humanism &amp; idealism that strikes a cord for us adults who have lost the plot, really. Who wants to be the arsehole to say &quot;There\'s  no career path in being a Catcher in the Rye&quot; ? <br />Here I am reminded of an exchange I had with a work colleague many years ago. I was upset by a clever magazine advertisement campaign, the spread was called &quot;Suit-a-cide&quot; , promoting well tailored mens suits.  The images were of glamorous guys stepping off buildings &amp; out of windows.  I was outraged and upset, whist my colleague\'s response was <br />&quot; Oh ha, let the Suits jump out the  window if that\'s what they want to do!  &quot; <br />I just felt that anecdote relayed very different attitudes to life; our own life and towards those around us.<br />I feel fortunate to have met Holden ( who may be unrealistically  infused with the reflections &amp; experiences of an adult author) thanks for that JD Salinger! <br /></p>\n\t\n\t<p class="links">\n\t    <a href="http://www2b.abc.net.au/tmb/View/NewMessage.aspx?b=304&amp;t=689&amp;tn=&amp;dm=1&amp;m=2253&amp;tpa=&amp;r=%2ftmb%2fView%2fMessage.aspx%3fb%3d304%26t%3d689%26a%3d0%26ps%3d50%26tpa%3d%26uto%3d1%26dm%3d4%26ci%3d0%26pd%3d1%26so%3dDateTime%26soa%3dTrue%26p%3d1%26p2%3d0">Reply</a>\n\t    \n\t    <a href="http://www2b.abc.net.au/tmb/View/AlertModerator.aspx?b=304&amp;m=2253&amp;tpa=&amp;r=%2ftmb%2fView%2fMessage.aspx%3fb%3d304%26t%3d689%26a%3d0%26ps%3d50%26tpa%3d%26uto%3d1%26dm%3d4%26ci%3d0%26pd%3d1%26so%3dDateTime%26soa%3dTrue%26p%3d1%26p2%3d0">Alert moderator</a>\n\t</p>\n\t<ul>\n\t\n\t</ul>\n</li>\n\t\t    \n\t</ul>\n</div>\n\t\t    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n  <div class="c25r aside sidebar">\n    <!--noindex-->\n  <div class="section cs-presenter ct-presenter-current">\n      <div class="inner cfix">\n        <div class="figure">\n           <a href="/radionational/programs/booksandarts/about/">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/image/6091708-1x1-80x80.jpg" alt="Program Unbranded Duo" title="Books and Arts" />\n</a></div>\n        <p class="time">\n          <strong>Monday to Friday 10am and Saturday 2pm to 3pm</strong>\n          <em>Repeated: <br/>Tuesday to Sunday 2am</em></p>\n        <p class="summary">Presented by <a href="/radionational/michael-cathcart/3050958">Michael Cathcart</a> and <a href="/radionational/melanie-tait/4284260">Melanie Tait</a></p>\n</div>\n  </div>\n<!--endnoindex-->\n</div>\n</div>\n<!--noindex-->\n  <div id="footer" class="cfix">\n    <h2><span>Explore Radio National</span></h2>\n    <div class="fs-footer-links">\n      <div class="subcolumns">\n      <div class="c25l"><div class="section">\n            <h3>General Information</h3>\n            <ul>\n              <li><a href="/radionational/contact/" >\n    Contact us</a></li>\n                <li><a href="/radionational/about/" >\n    About RN</a></li>\n                <li><a href="/radionational/presenters/" >\n    Presenters</a></li>\n                <li><a href="/radionational/social-media/" >\n    Social Media</a></li>\n                </ul>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      <div class="c25l"><div class="section">\n            <h3>Editorial</h3>\n            <ul>\n              <li><a href="/radionational/features/" >\n    Features</a></li>\n                <li><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/rntv/">RNTV</a></li>\n                <li><a href="/radionational/galleries/" >\n    Photo galleries</a></li>\n                </ul>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      <div class="c25l"><div class="section">\n            <h3>Help</h3>\n            <ul>\n              <li><a href="/radionational/frequency/" >\n    Find your frequency</a></li>\n                <li><a href="/radionational/help/listen/" >\n    How do I listen online?</a></li>\n                <li><a href="/radionational/help/podcasting/" >\n    What is podcasting?</a></li>\n                <li><a href="/radionational/help/rss/" >\n    What is an RSS feed?</a></li>\n                <li><a href="/radionational/help/download/" >\n    How do I download audio?</a></li>\n                </ul>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      <div class="c25r"><div class="section">\n            <h3>Subscribe</h3>\n            <ul>\n              <li><a href="/radionational/newsletters/" >\n    View all RN newsletters and subscribe</a></li>\n                <li><a href="/radionational/podcasts/program/" >\n    Subscribe to podcasts &amp;
