i
think
american
life
did
okay
with
go
from
fast
song
to
slow
song
rememb
mother
father
and
die
anoth
day
toward
the
end
i
m
glad
it
sold
3
million
copi
though
i
don
t
think
it
stay
at
the
top
for
too
mani
week
from
what
i
recal
and
i
was
worri
that
her
popular
was
go
down
but
i
didn
t
have
a
thing
to
worri
about
plus
though
i
ve
seen
her
be
appreci
in
nyc
i
ve
heard
from
mani
fan
that
she
s
not
realli
on
the
radio
in
the
us
with
newer
work
but
it
s
differ
up
north
madonna
has
alway
been
big
and
respect
here
and
her
singl
chart
well
for
the
rest
of
the
decad
and
the
confess
singl
were
huge
on
radio
i
agre
nobodi
s
perfect
is
great
wish
it
was
a
singl
i
caught
the
drown
world
tour
on
tv
a
coupl
of
time
back
then
but
wasn
t
feel
it
too
much
i
think
mayb
i
ll
embrac
nowaday
my
music
tast
has
widen
after
all
but
then
again
i
feel
madonna
had
her
concert
perform
peak
from
the
virgin
tour
through
the
girli
show
i
love
the
confess
stage
set
and

old
madonna
is
the
best
when

joetyl
i
love
and
love
that
album
a
perfect
sequel
to
the
spiritu
serious
ray
of
light
an
earthi
album
mix
both
organ
and
electron
music
danc
jam
and
also
guitar
orient
ballad
and
i
love
the
pun
against
the
whole
femal
singer
songwrit
genr
of
the
96
2001
era
lol
start
with
the
front
cover
she
was
obvioulsi
mock
that
movement
and
at
the
same
time
tri
to
get
some
out
of
it
as
well
the
onli
weak
song
for
me
was
nobodi
s
perfect
too
slow
but
the
rest
of
the
album
was
stellar
and
the
titl
track
was
the
jam
of
2000
i
serious
think
that
gone
is
her
most
underr
ballad
ever
american
life
was
a
similar
album
but
bleaker
and
with
lesser
materi
and
i
don
t
know
whi
but
the
electroclash
thing
sound
cheap
that
s
whi
i
don
t
care
for
that
album
it
s
madonna
follow
the
blueprint
of
a
previous
album
someth
that
she
never
did
befor
not
even
with
like
a
virgin
true
blue
which
were
reason
differ
album
if
you
think
about
it
anyway
i

i
didn
t
realiz
madonna
was
mock
singer
songwrit
of
the
late
90
s
especi
not
when
she
sign
alani
to
maverick
that
s
hilari
but
then
again
i
know
she
s
not
a
uniqu
guitar
player
though
she
alright
i
guess
caus
it
goe
well
with
her
music
and
american
life
track
and
those
late
90
s
artist
could
outshin
her
with
their
play
so
now
i
get
it
amaz
is
such
a
good
song
i
like
it
then
but
it
s
even
better
now
and
has
age
well
ahead
of
it
s
time
it
use
to
remind
me
of
beauti
stranger
but
now

i
rememb
be
in
love
with
this
album
when
it
came
out
haven
t
listen
to
it
as
a
whole
in
a
long
time
it
s
all
over
the
place
but
it
length
work
in
favor
of
the
disjoint
feel
name
the
album
music
there
s
noth
realli
meaning
behind
it
realli
right
the
album
feel
like
a
collect
of
song
without
a
real
concept
just
some
tune
that
she
and
her
collabor
put
togeth
the
contrast
of
her
imag
with
the
sound
was
pretti
interest
it
was
the
most
electron
read
synthet
she
had
gone
up
til
that
junction
of
her
career
but
dress
in
americana
read
organ
style
cloth
can
t
say
it
s
in
the
top
five
but
it
doe
have
one
of
my
favorit
ballad
paradis
not
for
me

paradis
is
my
least
favourit
on
there
i
wonder
what
made
her
name
the
album
music
the
divers
use
guitar
think
the
market
then
was
oversatur
with
too
much
teen
pop
and
r
b
danc
music
and
take
a
differ
approach
with
her
next
effort
refer
to
music
as
real
music
lol
i
do
hear
a
throwback
to
the
80
s
in
music
and
what
it
feel
like
for
a
girl
but
the
rest
sound
adult
contemporari
