year
old
tell
his
three
day
stori
in
277
page
constant
go
off
on
meaningless
tangent
about
past
experi
throughout
the
novel
we
see
holden
s
pessimist
view
of
societi
he
view
everyon
as
a
goddamn
phoni
and
seem

perhap
exclud
his
younger
sister
phoeb
at
some
point
holden
seem
like
a

the
world
and
clumsili
trip
through
it
for
the
first
time
and
other
an
old

honesti
he
s
spent

can
t
find
it
in
my
heart
to
feel
veri
bad
for
him
holden
claim
that
societi
has
the
problem
that
societi
is
out
to
get
him
that
societi
is
phoni
and
yet
holden
is
the
phoniest
of
all
he

be
the

oxymoron
of
