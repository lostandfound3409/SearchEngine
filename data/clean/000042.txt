i
rememb
at
my
vast
old
age
in
7th
grade
sad
conclud
that
i
was
too
old
for
the
narnia
book
now
i
had
alreadi
read
them
mani
time
then
i
took
them
up
again
in
colleg
and
found
new
rich
i
know
i
will
never
“outgrow”
them
again
no
kid
who
read
this
book
will
ever
look
at
a
closet
door
the
same
way
again

the
first
seri
i
read
to
myself
start
halfway
through
when
i
switch
from
listen
to
my
mom
read
them
aloud
to
sneak
them
off
to
my
room
to
read
ahead
i
was
convinc
that
someday
i
would
meet
the
pevensi
and
tell
them
that
i
knew
about
narnia
too
sad
turkish
delight
did
not
live
up
to
my
expect

still
rememb
the
day
i
finish
this
book
lay
on
my
parent’
famili
room
couch
on
a
bright
sunni
summer
day
i
would
have
been
play
outsid
in
the
sprinkler
had
i
been
abl
to
put
it
down
instead
i
was
sob
on
the
couch
as
aslan
die
i
finish
it
and
read
it
again
and
again
i
don’t
alway
think
the
oldest
most
classic
version
of
a
tale
is
the
one
that
kid
should
keep
rend
if
someon
els
come
along
and
doe
the
tale
better
by
all
mean
let’
read
that
one…

has
anyon
done
this
better

i
rememb
a
sens
of
magic
while
read
the
chronicl
of
narnia
as
a
child
and
i’m
not
refer
to
the
magic
contain
in
the
storylin
but
rather
the
giddi
awe
of
fall
into
the
stori
it
was
thrill
it’
a
veri
specif
emot
one
i
don’t
think
we
have
a
word
for
one
i
don’t
think
i’v
ever
felt
as
an
adult

but
it’
an
emot
that
i
rememb
perfect
the
charact
and
world
seem

it’
one
of
the
few

i
realli
felt
transport
to

through

to
100
best
book
for
children
by
anita
silvey
do
you
own
your
copi
yet
when
lewi
was
sixteen
he
envis
a
faun
carri
an
umbrella
in
a
wood
full
of
snow
“then
nine
year
later
a
lion
leapt
into
a
stori
and
lewi
began
work
on
a
book
entitl
‘the
lion’
”
i
was
unawar
that
he
was
onli
twenti
five
when
he
began
the
tale
he’d
be
fifti
two
by
the
time
it
publish
though
that’
what
we
call
in
the
busi
a
gestat
period
he
did
show
an
earli
manuscript
to
one
roger
lancelyn
green
though
and
green
help
him
get
his
manuscript
up
to
snuff
the
book
was
origin
meant
to
stand
alon
which
is
part
of
the
reason
it
bug
me
when
publish
releas
the
book
in
the
order
of
what
happen
in
the
seri
rather
than
the
order
of
when
the
book
were
written
of
cours
he
was
bud
with
j
r
r
tolkien
though
perhap
“buds”
is
not
the
term
they
might
choos
to
describ
their
friendship
tolkien
wasn’t
a
fan
of
the
seri
though
consid
he
was
a
fellow
who
spent
age
construct
a
histori
and
a
bloodi
languag
for
his
fantast
world
he
found
the
whole
narnia
thing
a
bit
slapdash
now
if
you
walk
into
the
book
as
a
kid
and
aren’t
awar
that
you’r
face
a
great
big
gigant
christian
allegori
you
probabl
won’t
notic
it
anyway
for
adult
it’
incred
obvious
still
as
anita
silvey
say
“the
book
have
endur
not
becaus
of
their
philosophi
but
becaus
they
bring
to
life
a
magic
world
that
reader
want
to
enter
again
and
again
”
philip
pullman
not
a
fan
in
an
interview
with
surefish
com
for
exampl
he
say
“narnia
has
alway
seem
to
me
to
be
mark
by
a
hatr
of
the
physic
world
when
i
bring
this
up
peopl
say
oh
no
what
nonsens
he
love
his
beer
love
laughter
and
smoke
a
pipe
and
the
companionship
of
his
friend
and
so
on
and
so
he
might
have
done
but
that
didn’t
prevent
perhap
his
unconsci
mind
from
say
someth
quit
differ
in
the
form
of
a
stori
”
i
can’t
even
wade
through
the
thousand
of
scholar
articl
on
this
book
or
even
the
book
base
on
it
i
will
highlight

record
how
“mi

would
turn
out
to
be
as
rocki
as
ani
love

a
stori
of
enchant

and
reunion
”
in
fact
miller
allow
a
section
from
the
introduct
of
the
book
to
be
includ
in
anita
silvey’
everyth
i
need
to
know
i
learn
from
a
children’
book
she
write
“in
