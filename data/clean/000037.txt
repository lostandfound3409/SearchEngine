is
a
clever
combin
of
both
genr
this
book
has
everi
ingredi
for
the
ideal
murder
mysteri
with
a
pinch
of
exot
element
it
made
me
understand
that
human

engag
make
your

more

you
splash
the

so
that
it
is
imposs
to
stop
read
even
for
a
moment
incorpor
the
nurseri
rhyme
“ten
littl
indians”
is
a
brilliant
foreshadow
techniqu
and
the

of
each
charact

dure
the
exposit
add
to
the

the

the

is
disturb
yet
sophist
without

instead
the
