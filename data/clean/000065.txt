what
i
have
to
do
i
have
to
catch

–
i

i
have
to
come
out
from

i’d
just

all
i

but
that’
the
onli
thing
i’d
realli
like
to

i
thought
do
you
ever
regret
not
be
abl
to
tell
a
person—or
in
this
case
a
place—goodby
what
i
was
realli
hang
around
for
i
was
tri
to
feel
some
kind
of
a
good
by
i
mean
i’v
left
school
and
place
i
didn’t
even
know
i
was
leav
them
i
hate
that
i
don’t
care
if
it’
a
sad
good
by
or
a
bad
good
by
but
when
i
leav
a
place
i
like
to
know
i’m
leav
it
if
you
don’t
you
feel
even
wors
lowlight
the
fact
that
the
catcher
in
the
rye
was
j
d
salinger’
onli

he
did
publish
mani

stori
and
novella
but
he
spent
his
last
50

in
near
total

talent
with

“all

hate
it

final
thought
the
catcher
in

is
a
classic
of

read

it’

my
onli
gripe
about
this
novel
is
that
a
bunch
of
stuff
happen
but
doesn’t
seem
to
follow
ani
real
plot
format
that’
familiar
to
me
as

i’m
confus
and
in
awe
catcher
in
the

is
an
american
classic
novel
and
definit
broke
ground
for
a
lot
of
modern
literatur
and
even

i
think
the
brilliant
thing
about
it
lack
of
ani
real
plot
format
is
that
one
of
it
central
theme
the
journey
into
adulthood
doesn’t
have
ani
real

i
read
catcher
in
the
rye
again
yesterday
and
i
still
love
it
he’
so
quick
to
point
out
the
flaw
of
other
and
can’t
recogn
a
singl
flaw
in
himself
he
take
great
admir
in
be
a
liar
and
crazi
at
time
i
also
love
how
he
is
so
impuls
go
off
on
tangent
that
have
no
link
to
what
is
go
on
in
the
present
time
my
favourit
part
has
to
be
when
phoeb
ask
him
what
he
would
love
to
do
and
he
struggl
to
come
up
with
one
it
is
my
favourit
book
by
far
i’ll
read
it
again
soon
i
love
the
continu
curs
throughout
the
book
also
constant
say
‘it
kill
me’
