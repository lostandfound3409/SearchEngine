it
liter
is
difficult
to
find
ani
flaw

movi
and
even
if
there
is
it
will
immedi
be
forgiven
by
the
next
major
laugh
or
the
next
major
revel
the
predict
factor
in
this
movi
is
low
and
the
payoff
to
all
the
suspens
is
extrem
high
guy

is
the

deeper

surfac
this

is
about
the
toy
in
a
seri
of

wind
up

that
isn

grow

on
michael
arndt
the
oscar
winner
that
wrote
littl
miss
sunshin
was
behind
the
spectacular
screenplay
in
this
third
trip
in
the
world
of
toy
then
with
the
help
of
john
lasset
and
lee
unkrich
who
serv
as
the
director
we
see
plenti
of
refer
to
pixar
other
movi
the
previous
toy
stori
instal
and
even
we
even
see
nod
to
the
influenc
of
the
entir
anim
studio
miyazaki
the
write
wasn
t
the
onli
thing
that
was
on
par
with
the
first
two
toy
stori
movi
the
voic
act
cast
was
onc
again
phenomen
with
popular
actor
underr
talent
and
great

unlik
what
dreamwork
pull
off
on
a
year
basi
pixar
care
choos
their
voic
cast
in
term
of
pull
off
the
best
perform
not
to
generat
more
money
becaus
honest
was
there
even
a
point
to

on

veri
few
can
pull

take
reliabl
and
authent
act
to
pull
at
the
heartstr
and
everyon
definit
was
on
their
a
game
lee
unkrich
direct
this
movi
with
incred
pace
and
just
as
much
heart
and
dedic
as
lasset
who
was
in
charg
of
the
first
two
the
truth
is
pixar
direct
the
movi
togeth
as
they
share
idea
and
suggest
amongst
each
other
this
fact
can
be
trace
to
the
similar
pace
and
direct
style
seen
in
pixar
s
better
work
like
ratatoill
find
nemo
and
up
they
all
have
the
similar
techniqu
of
incorpor
just
as
mani
tear
as
laugh
but
unlik
all
the
other
pixar
movi
with
the
except
of
the
incred
toy
stori
3
has
a
heav
dosag
of
suspens
and
peril
which
is
climax
by
one
of
the
most
excit
anim
sequenc
this

sinc
1995
pixar

creat
walt
disney
