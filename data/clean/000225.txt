had
an
undeni
effect
on
cinema
be
one
of
the
first
movi
to
use
cgi
at
such
a
larg
scale
howev
the
most
ingeni
aspect
of
the
film
is
the
portray
of
the
dinosaur
as
anim
rather
than
ruthless
monster
at
mani
time
throughout
the
movi
the
human
are
portray
as
antagonist
and
the
respect
and
appreci
of
the
dinosaur
is
wonder

and
best
of
all
like
