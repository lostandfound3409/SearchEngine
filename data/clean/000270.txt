began
to

the
evolut
of

presley
s
sound
some
critic
have
claim
that
the
qualiti
of
elvi

began
to
deterior
at
rca
they
blame
the
declin
on
commerci
calcul
the
tight
structur
schedul
for

at

compar
to
the
makeshift
down

desir

of
dean
martin
elvi
music
did
undergo
some
chang
onc
he
move
to
rca
but
the
word
declin
is
too
harsh
to
use
to
describ
the
modif
of
his
sound
elvi
music
did
not
declin
at
rca
but
it
did
move
away
from
rockabilli
to
more
mainstream
rock
n
roll
by
the
1960s
it
would
mellow
into
a
bona
fide
pop
sound
part
of
the
modif
of
his
music
was
the
result
of
deal
elvi
and
the
colonel
made
with
music
publish
hill

the

gave
up
a
larg
percentag
of

to

for

they
were
also

even
though
he
never
wrote
a
