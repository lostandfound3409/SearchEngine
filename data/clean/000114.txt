i
was
actual
introduc
to
this
book
in
one
of
the
best
way
i
can
imagin
a
friend
record
the
entir
book
on
tape
and
for
a
coupl
month
i
play
the
tape
of
her
read
a
chapter
or
two
just
befor
i
fell
asleep
each
night
my
slow
exposur
to
the
book
under
ideal
circumst
may
have
influenc
my
percept
but
i
can
say
on
each
subsequ
reread
of
the
book
i
ve
come
to
appreci
it
more
you
can
read
the
book
just
for
the
stori
appar
the
author
wrote
the
book
from
stori
he
would
tell
his
children
and
it
still
can
easili
serv
that
purpos
but
the
rich
of
his
charact
lead
to
mani
interest
analog
to
human
life
for
instanc
from
hazel
you
can
learn
profound
thing
about
leadership
throughout
the
book
you
feel
that
hazel
is
the
natur
born
leader
of
his
group
of
rabbit
but
richard
adam
was
veri
care
to
develop
this
impress
through
charact
featur
rather
than
power
relat
the
contrast
is
clear
intent
sinc
the
other
leader
of
the
book
achiev
leadership
status
through
veri
differ
mean
mani
peopl
think
the
book
take
a
strong
stanc
against
a
particular
kind
of
authoritarian
rule
but
it
is
import
to
recogn
the
book
give
this
impress
not
through
structur
diatrib
or
through
argument
but
rather
it
evolv
out
of
charact
consider
and
out
of
the
stori
itself
this
mean
that
the
result
is
far
more
complex
than
a
simpl
argument
for
instanc
although
general
woundwort
may
be
seen
as
the
main
enemi
that
hazel
has
to
deal
with
and
the
authoritarian
rabbit
is
portray
rather
negat
at
time
adam
quit
intent
add
some
detail
that
make
him
admir
to
the
other
rabbit
even
to
the
veri
end
a
diatrib
would
not
be
so
complex
fiver
is
anoth
great
charact
he
add
an
element
of
magic
to
the
stori
and
it
allow
adam
to
link
the
rabbit
he
describ
to
a
mythic
world
that
enter
into
the
stori
quit
frequent
one
can
almost
see
fiver
as
a
manifest
of
imagin
in
this
world
big
wig
is
anoth
likabl
charact
and
the
stori
of
this
rabbit
experi
in
efrafa
is
one
of
the
highlight
of
the
stori
besid
the
charact
the
descript
of
england
are
also
quit
acut
you
can
actual
track
the
cours
of
the
rabbit
on
map
sinc
adam
was
care
to
describ
real
place
and
thing
that
attent
to
detail
is
often
miss
in
review
of
this
book
final
the
thing
that
bring
all
these
featur
togeth
and
make
the
book
more
than
a
mere
stori
or
an
account
of
human
charact
or
a
diatrib
against
fascism
is
the
fact
that
adam
is
quit
conscious
of
the
fact
that
he
is
tell
the
stori
from
the
perspect
of
rabbit
the
challeng
they
face
are
rabbit
size
the
idea
about
the
extern
world
are
rabbitlik
the
philosoph
insight
seem
rabbit
and
adam
bring
mani
of
our
anthropomorph
idea
of
rabbit
togeth
with
the
realiti
of
rabbit
in
a
surpris
coher
fashion
i
suppos
the
book
can
be
seen
as
a
cultur
studi
of
an
imagin
rich
but
realist
rabbit
world
i
realiz
as
i
write
this
review
that
mani
other
reader
may
not
feel
the
same
way
about
the
book
as
i
do
it
doe
have
some
shortcom

charact
onli
make

although
i
think
adam
doe
show
some
sensit
in
their
depict
but
even
with
the
limit
i
would
recommend
the

doe
a
neat

in

the

make

though
at

they

vari
enough
to

the

they
have
their

and
perhap
most

these
stori
pepper
throughout
the

are
some
of
the
most

and
add
a

fill
certain

even
if

taken

when

convinc
nine
other

to
leav

with
them
driven
by
fear
and

they
begin
an

that
if

to
hear
about
would
have
given

manag

through
the
thicket
of
a
new
and
danger
world
they
meet
other
warren
of
rabbit
with
societi
aberr
that
made
them
unpalat
for
amalgam
given
the
way
that
richard
adam
portray
these
rigid
social
construct
i
came
away
with
the
feel
that
he
was
somewhat
anti
govern
he
seem
to
be
advoc
that
a
looser
structur
of
co
exist
will
lead
to
happier
rabbit
peopl
speak
of
that
even
though
these
rabbit
did
take
on
some
human
characterist
i
never
realli
thought
of
them
as
peopl
i
was
convinc
i
was
read
a
book
about
rabbit
not
rabbit
with
human
face
that
to
me
is
a
major
achiev
and
at
the
same
time
in
the
earli
page
made
me
feel
like
i
was
read
a
book
at
a
read
level
below
my
comfort
zone
rabbit
are
relat
simpl
anim
and
adam
adher
to
that
principl
for
most
of
the
book
clever
was
a
rever
trait
among
warren
coloni
and
is
reflect
in
their
stori
of
past
accomplish
by
legendari
rabbit
these
stori
pass
down
oral
from
generat
to
generat
provid
a
collect
sourc
of
cun
skill
that
are
appli
to
situat
beyond
the
natur
experi
of
our
erstwhil
hero
it
doesn
t
take
long
for
the
all
male
coloni
to
realiz
that
if
they
want
kitten
they
must
have
doe
they
were
in
such
a
hurri
to
escap
the
warren
that
they
forgot
to
bring
the
mystic
other
half
necessari
for
reproduct
they
came
to
the
same
conclus
that
tribal
unit
have
come
to
for
thousand
of
year
if
they
don
t
have
someth
they
need
than
they
need
to
liber
it

an
iron
fist
the
efrafa
happen
to
have
a
plethora
of
doe
and
hazel
and
his
band
of
intrepid
bunni
believ
they
are
clever
enough
with
the
help
of
some
unusu
alli
to
coax
away
enough
doe
to
insur
the
surviv
of
their
fledgl
societi
this
set
up
one
of
the
most
puls
pound
showdown
i
ve
read
in
a
long
time
display
the
courag
of
the
defend
of
the
alamo
and
the
steadfast
of
the
spartan
at
the

found
myself
glow
with
the
pride
of
a
particip
white
knuckl
and
all
as
the
watership
down
rabbit
defend
their
home
the
thing
about
this
book
is
that
you
have
to
hang
in
there
i
have
start
and
stop
this
book
a
hand
of

sever
review

convinc
me
i
was
give
up
on
the
book
too
soon
at

70
i
could
feel
my
eye
look
over
with
long
at
the
stack

wait
in

wing
as

up
i
start
to

about
this
band
of

i
wish
that
i
had
read
it
in
time
to
have
share
it
with
my

there
is
much
to
be
discuss
especi
in
regard
to
how
societi
are
structur
about
courag
about
friendship
about
think
outsid
the
box
and
about
the
import
of
how
we
conduct
ourselv
within
our
own
warren
township
if
you
have

young
enough
read
it
to

it
will
heighten
the

one
of
the
mani

that

is
the

what

the
languag
that
the

is
a
small
joy
to
see
among
mani
thing
which
i
found
lovabl
and
admir
in
the

protagonist
of

their
love
of

he

the
stori
of

and
his
adventur
are
sprinkl
throughout
the
main
narrat
and
serv
as
inspir
and
entertain
for

and
as
a
way
to
find
courag
in
hard
time
a
review
in
the
new
statesman
prais
richard
adam
for
write
a
big
tens
picaresqu
stori
these
three
adject
probabl
best
describ
watership
down
peopl
have
seen
in
it
a
riff
on
the
oddysey
an
allegori
for
human
struggl
against
totalitarian
oppress
fascism
the
cold
war
but
at
it
heart
it
is
a
wonder
stori
about
a
group
of
rabbit
search
for
a
new
home
and
their
effort
at
establish
a
warren
they
provid
for
interest
protagonist
and
as
they
journey
goe
on
so
do
their
respect
role
develop
these
are
to
a
degre
archetyp
but
richard
adam
is
care
to
make
sure
that
each
rabbit
retain
it
individu
characterist
and
grow
as
the
stori
progress
relat
between
the
charact
are
not
black
and
white
as
in
mani
book
for
children
even
though
the
villain
figur
is
portray
with
obvious
negat
adam
make
an
effort
to
show
whi
it
would
be
influenti
and
admir
by
mani
other
rabbit
all
the
way
to
the
veri
end
occasion
adam
will
do
some
authori
intrus
and
explain
the
rabbit
habit
of
his
protagonist
but
he
did
write
this
book
base
on
the
stori
he
told
their
kid
and
they
probabl
ask
mani
question
concern
these
matter
as
most
kid
would
it
s
not
a
big
problem
at
all
and
can
actual
be
seen
a
nice
remind
about
the
root
of

in

was

at

and
the
rabbit
have
escap
the
field
of

and
settl
on
watership
down
hide
spoiler
i
didn
t
realli
think
so
it
seem
like
it
had
been
too
easi
and
anticlimact
there
were
no
femal
charact
i
also
felt
that
the
theme
of
human
impact
be
negat
and
destruct
was
a
littl
too
easi
novelist
now
as
then
have
their
environment
impact
as
do
we
all
it
s
easi
to
suggest
that
human
are
degrad
their
environ
harder
to
say
what
should
be
done
about
it
given
that
we
are
all
complicit
in
it
and
adam
make
no
effort
at
all
in
that
direct
littl
did
i
suspect
that
this
was
just
the
pre
ambl
to
a
tremend
adventur
in
which
this
theme
would
be
drop
almost
entir
and
the
focus
would
shift
toward
question
of
leadership
govern
and
the
will
to
power
or
that
the
lack
of
femal
rabbit
would
turn
out
to
be
crucial
to
what
was
go
to
happen
next
now
a
bunch
of
talk
rabbit
should
realli
be
laughabl
but
they
realli
aren
t
how
doe
adam
acheiv
this
part
by
creat
convinc
charact
someth
that
is
of
cours
crucial
to
the
success
of
ani
novel
but
that
doesn
t
resolv
the
absurd
of
talk
rabbit
one
method
adopt
by
adam
is
to
rememb
that
they
are
rabbit
not
just
metamorphos
human
which
one
might
think
would
be
counter
product
but
turn
out
not
to
be
so
these
rabbit
behav
like
rabbit
and
where
human
cultur
attitud
conflict
with
the
general
behaviour
of
rabbit
rabbit
behaviour
is
kept
rabbit
behaviour
is
also
describ
in
detail
from
a
posit
of
knowledg
but
here
s
what
make
the
whole
thing
realli
work
the
rabbit
have
a
languag
folk
tale
myth
legend
and
religion
all
their
own
the
floati
black
rabbit
from
the
film
symbolis
death
and
in
the
book
is
a
good
deal
less
floati
more
corpor
and
even
more
scari
this
doesn
t
stop
the
vagu
promethean
ancestor
father
trickster
rabbit
of
rabbit
legend
take

decis
ever

love
to
tell
stori
they
sit
around
and
tell
their
best
or
most
ador
stori
to
one
anoth
in
time
of
need
what
is
it
that
they
need
comfort
of
cours
when
they
feel
scare
nervous
tire
or
homesick
they
perk
their
ear
up
and
sit
quiet
by
as
one
of
their
own
tell
a
stori
listen
to
watership
down
was
an
experi
all
on
it
own
one
that
i
will
never
forget
let
me
introduc
you
to
fiver
heâ€™
a
wee
littl
rabbit
who
get
overlook
in
an

and
has
these
premonit
that
he
can
not
control
so
one
day
he
hop
on
over
to
his
brother
hazel
and
tell
him
â€œsometh

this
way
we
must
leav
at
onc
there
are
rule
and
a
system
of
hierarchi
that
prevent
them
from

just
that
they
must
take
appropri
action
in

to
get
the

mani
of
the

hazel
is
a
prime
exampl
of
that
hazel
is
unsur
of
his
stand
among
his
peer

guess
himself
while

decis
that
he
think
will
help
his

him
such
a

that
should
be
read
with
survivorâ€™
eye
of
the
tiger
play
in
the
background
on
the
characteris
side
it
is
worth
note
that
the
rabbit
in
this
book
are
not
anthropomorph
anim
they
do
not
wear
cloth
drive
car
watch
tv
etc
yet
there
is
also
much
human
in
their
rabbitri
they
can
be
compassion
love
kind
cruel
egotist
melancholi
etc
these
human
trait
are
believ
portray
as
rabbit
trait
through
the
incred

of
richard

the

that

enjoy

what
they
realli
enjoy
is
feel
proof
against
it
for
them
there
is
no
winter
food
problem
they
have
fire
and
warm
cloth
the
winter
can
not
hurt
them
and
therefor
increas
their
sens
of
clever
and
secur
for
bird
and
anim
as
for

winter

would
be
worth
it
to

i
had
the

unknow

i
just
recent
got
around
to
pick
it
up
base
on
my
memori
of
the
film
version
i
was
expect
game
of
throne
with
rabbit
i
was
expect
a
relentless
parad
of
death
and
despair
this
isn
t
what
i
got
yes
this
is
a
matur
book
and
it
is
realist
and
honest
about
the
rabbit
s
place
in
the
world
and
it
certain
doesn
t
shi
away
from
the
realiti
of
their
place
in
the
food
chain
but
i
was
expect
crush
tragedi
after
crush
tragedi
and
what
i
got
was
a
much
more
balanc
depict
of
the
rabbit
s
life
i
wasn
t
disappoint
that
my
expect
didn
t
match
this
book
s
content
this
was
a
slower
read
for
me
but
this
i
have
to
admit
can
be
at
least
in
part
attribut
to
the
circumst
surround
my
read
of
the
book
i
was
extrem
busi
while
read
this
and
the
onli
time
i
had
to
read
was
just
befor
bed
the
book
didn
t
keep
me
up
i
was
out
in
under
fifteen
minut
almost
everi
night
after
the
old
kindl
slap
me
in
the
face
multipl
time
as
i
nod
off
but
structur
it
didn
t
feel
like
a
novel
it
felt
like
a
collect
of
interconnect
stori
or
a
fix
up
until
about
the
halfway
mark
when
we
re
at
long
last
introduc
to
the
book
s
central
conflict
anoth
aspect
of
the
book
that
slow
it
down
for
me
was
the
stori
within
the
stori
about
rabbit
folklor
these
stori
in
themselv
i
found
entertain
but
they
did
kill
the
momentum
for
me
everi
time
overal
i
enjoy
this
book
a
great
deal
and
i
think
it
will
be
one
that
will
stick
in
my
memori
for
year
to
come
it
s
a
rich
book
with
a
layer
narrat
there
are
beauti
passag
sprinkl
throughout
an
obvious
respect
for
natur
and
a
passion
for
natur
s
beauti
serv
as
a
nice
contrast
to
the
harrow

of

the

first
biblic
in

then
dystopian
it
veer
sudden
into

return
again
to

final
settl

how
could

even

approach
deleeâ€™
own
most
excel
review
of
her
favorit
book
of
all
time
but
i
do
want
to
add
a
few
thought
out
of
respect
for
my
dear
dele
i
was
go
to
give
watership
down
five
star
â€”
no
matter
what
my
memori
had
been
of
a
three
star
novel
enjoy
but
not
realli
the
classic
that
so
mani
tout
but
i
did
not
have
to
lie
onc
i
began
to
listen
to
the
audiobook
which
i
check
out
at
overdr
through
my
librari
i
was
mesmer
the
stori
prove
so
captiv
â€”
even
though
i
still
rememb
the
broad
outlin
of
the
plot
i
had
certain
complet
forgotten
how
suspens
the
end
of
the
novel
was
ralph
coshamâ€™
melliflu
voic
narrat
the
watership
down
audiobook
i
believ
at
least
half
of
my
enjoy
i
owe
to
him
begun
as
a
stori
richard
adam
told
to
his
daughter
juliet
and
rosamund
on
a
long
car
trip
to
statford
upon
avon
the
book
was
reject
seven
time
befor
a
publish
had
the
foresight
to
take
it
on
like
the
initi
rabbit
warren
that
the
intrepid
bunni
inhabit
which
couldnâ€™t
believ
the
underestim
fiverâ€™
clairvoy
abil
most
publish
couldnâ€™t
fathom
how
a
book
this
origin
could
possibl
find
a
market
in
his
introduct
author
richard
adam
say
his
novel
was
never
intend
as
an
allegori
i
find
that
hard
to
believ
still
even
if
he
never
intend
watership
down
as
an
allegori
it
publish
histori
â€”
the
intrepid
bunni
make
it
despit
the
odd
â€”
make
the
book
into
one
the
rabbitsâ€™
start
point
sandleford
their
promis
land
watership
down
and
nuthang
farm
the
hampshir
farm
from
which
hazel
and
compani
recruit
some
domest
rabbit
are
all
real
place
which
adam
knew
well
this
point
serv
