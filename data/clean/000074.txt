purchas
i
have
no
real
excus
for
not
read
lolita
befor
this
late
date
it
s
certain
a
book
that
crop
up
in
convers
a
great
deal
i
watch
the
jame
mason
film
version
of
the
book
year
ago
perhap
that
s
what
put
me
off
i
recent
watch
the
jeremi
iron
version
and
love
it
i
suppos
part
of
me
ask
whi
myself
whi
i
d
want
to
read
a
book
that
is
essenti
the
rambl
of
a
middl
age
pervert
anyway
i
decid
that
i
d
procrastin
long
enough
and
it
was
time
to
get
serious
and
find
out
what
all
the
fuss
is
about
the
stori
is
narrat
by
middl
age
humbert
humbert
he
s
a
pedophil
although
he
s
tri
deni
it
tri
disguis
it
and
tri
channel
his
baser
instinct
but
as
luck
would
have
it
humbert
find
himself
as
the
lodger
at
the
home
of
a
buxom
lone
widow
charlott
haze
and
12
year
old
daughter
lolita
humbert
doesn
t
particular
even
like
lolita
he
actual
find
her
rather
dull
but
she
becom
a
vessel
for
the
fantasi
left
by
humbert
s
unfulfil
first
love
affair
due
to
the
subject
matter
the
book
was
at
time
rather
difficult
to
read
and
it
is
a
tribut
to
nabokov
s
skill
as
a
writer
that
i
was
grip
by
this
stori
humbert
humbert
is
at
his
most
human
introspect
dure
his
pre
and
post
lolita
phase
onc
humbert
cross
the
boundari
of
ethic
behaviour
and
begin
a
physic
relationship
with
lolita
there
is
no
go
back
at
time
humbert
congratul
himself
for
his
clever
and
call
himself
a
magician
and
then
at
other
time
humbert
seem
to
realiz
how
despic
he
truli
is
unfortun
the
occasion
flash
of
insight
is
too
pale
and
fleet
to
releas
humbert
from
his
obsess
with
his
nymphet
and
so
humbert
accept
his
enslav

this
is
a
magnific
book
in
mani
way
most
of
which
have
been
comment
on
often
brilliant
by
amazon
review
i
would
therefor
like
to
restrict
my
comment
to
the
moral
of
the
book
and
to
those
who
to
this
day
view
the
book
with
outrag
even
those
who
admir
the
book
somehow
feel
compel
to
comment
that
they
are
disturb
by
it
whi
is
this
let
us
first
examin
the
novel
itself
as
everybodi
know
it
is
the
stori
of
humbert
humbert
a
full
grown
adult
male
not
an
old
man
who
seduc
a
compliant
twelv
year
old
girl
and
then
goe
on
to
have
a
year
or
so
long
affair
with
her
i
put
the
term
affair
in
quotat
mark
becaus
it
probabl
isn
t
appropri
to
describ
a
sexual
relationship
between
a
full
grown
male
and
a
femal
child
in
such
term
is
it
safe
to
say
that
most
ration
human
be
disapprov
of
such
relationship
it
is
certain
safe
to
say
that
nabakov
and
his
narrat
know
that
such
relationship
are
wrong
this
is
import
the
tale
is
not
onli
told
in
the
context
of
a
moral
univers
it
is
also
told
by
a
charact
who
is
in
accept
of
a
moral
univers
oh
he
make
a
comment
here
and
there
about
some
mediev
king
marri
his
twelv
year
old
cousin
but
clear
his
heart
isn
t
in
it
he
know
that
he
is
a
monster
a
brute
inde
his
goal
was
never
to
have
sex
with
a
conscious
lolita
to
begin
with
his
goal
initi
was
onli
to
fondl
her
after
drug
her
to
induc
sleep
she
was
never
to
know
what
he
was
do
of
cours
this
is
also
reprehens
but
clear
it
show
a
conscienc
at
work
a
conscienc
motiv
in
part
by
fear
to
be
sure
but
also
a
conscienc
for
the
welfar
at

earli
