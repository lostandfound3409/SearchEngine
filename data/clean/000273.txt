uhhhhh
this
is
way
off
american
life
is
great
from
begin
to
end
when
she’
rap
in
the
titl
song
american
life
she’
be
iron
also
she
was
a
middl
age
blond
white
woman
at
the
time
and
she
obvious
knew
that
rap
would
piss
peopl
off
so
that
was
just
anoth
reason
to
do
it
american
life
has
serious
great
lyric
i
e
intervent
nobodi
know
me
noth
fail
x
static
process
and
love
profus
to
just
name
a
few
hard
candi
is
lyric
fun
and
inspir
especi
incred
she
was
just
danc
and
have
fun
“i
know
that
you
think
i’m
crazi
and
i
don’t
want
you
to
save
me
i
have
never
felt

–
and
yall
think
she’
crazi
mdna
–
awesom
amaz
tour
bed
time
stori
is
more
than
just
an
album
to
have
sex
to
great
lyric
about
the
loss
of
love
one
stay
true
to
yourself
express
yourself
and
not
repress
yourself
and
say
fuck
off
to
someon
you
were
in
love
with
if
anyth
this
is
not
the
album
to
have
sex
to
i
guess
you
just
think
all
r
b
ish
sound
thing
equal
sex
put
true

befor
music
is
fuck
up
so
is
make
madonna
1
what
madonna
is
a
great
album
but
i
think
number
one
is
wayyyyyyyi
out
of
line
i
don’t
think
it
is
quit
possibl
to
compar
all
her
album
becaus
they
are
all
so
differ
i
think
everyon
has
a
favorit
base
on
what
phase
in
their
live
that
they
are
at
current
i
would
say
that
bed

stori
is
my
most
listen
to
but
i
am
alway
chang
which
of
these
great

ok
i
will
be
bust
out
the
madonna
track
for
my
even
run
tonight
thank
to
this
articl
but
umm…
and
i
know
that
music
is
subjective…but
where
is
someth
to
rememb
on
this
list
grant
i
love
the
pop
stuff
particular
from
the
80s
period
but
i
love
the
album
someth
to
rememb
it
was
that
period
where
she
was
critic
for
not
have
ballad
and
not
realli
be
a
great
“singer”
when
i’m
not
in
the
mood
for
the
pop
stuff
i
love
the
laid
back
flow
of
someth
to
rememb
i
want
you
i’ll
rememb
which
was
the
theme
and
song
from
my
senior
prom
for
which
i
had
major
influenc
sinc
i
was
senior
class
presid
take
a
bow
this
use
to
be
my
playground
someth
to
rememb
and
rain
are
my
favorit
from
that
album
i
just
love
that
album
so
much
probabl
won’t
get
much
agreement
but
my
all
time
favorit
madonna
song
and
video
remain
