and
i
fulli
agre
the
reason
for
my
bad

of

as
someon
els
mention
we
all
know
the
lord
of
the
ring
to
be
by
the
far
one
of
the
greatest
work
of
write
of
the
20th
centuri
it
is
all
a
game
we
play
with
tolkien
for
he
too
took
it
much
more
serious
then
ani
other
fantasi
of
scienc
fiction
writer
ever
has
he
made
up
languag
that
exist
in
relationship
to
languag
and
dialect
that
we
have
in
english
and
thus
creat
a
nightmar
for
translat
he
told
stori
of
all
sort
of
peril
of
creation
and
made
sure
everyth
was
done
right
thus
when
an
edit
like
this
come
out
it
is
truli
pain
for
one
origin
tolkien
creat
some
of
the
most
beauti
map
of
middl
earth
spend
time
make
sure
that
all
of
the
proport
were
accur
he
didn
t
just
jumbl
down
some
line
for
the
coast
line
for
exampl
he
spent
mani
hour
make
sure
everyth
was
proportin
and
made
sens
howev
sometim
after
1988
ballantin
start
to
releas
edit
of
the
triliogi
with
complet
new
map
all
sign
by
some
shelli
shapiro
in
either
case
these
new
map
were
plaug
with
problem
from
be
too
cartooni
and
unproportin
to
have
name
of
locat
from
the
origin
map
done
away
with
the
map
from
the
veri
begin
have
been
essenti
to
the
lotr
book
and
have
cheap
map
made
is
annoy
beyond
belief
it
show
a
sign
of
disrespect
from
the
editor
to
me
it
say
peopl
won
t
notic
anyway
let
make
a
smaller
size
book
with
less
detail
map
and
save
some
money
if
you
truli
want
to
expieri
this
epic
or
histori
more
accur
as
tolkien
envis
it
not
some
editor
at
ballantin
spend
some
extra
cash
and
either
get
a
differ
edit
or
buy
a
good
map
there
is
current
an
excel
one
made
by
christoph
tolkien
which
is
much
larger
and
detail
of
cours
were
the
map
adequ
this
edit
still
suffer
from
annoy
miscopi
and
misprint
and
so
on
don
t
sell
out
for
cheap
