that
the
artistri
the
songwrit
and
the
vocal
and
instrument
rich
of
these
album
so
often
get
overlook
in

of
greatest
hit
commerci
song
at
the
intermiss
my
wife
said
how
surpris
she
was
about
the
depth
and
qualiti
of
sir
elton
s
work
sure
she
knew
about
a
lot
of
the
big
number
but
indian
sunset
and
those
song
brand
new
experi
for
her
did
you
know
that
song
do
you
have
that
album
congrat
folk
i
think
you
ve
made
a
new
deep
cut
fan
how
did
john
and
lyricist
berni
taupin
nail
that
kind
of
feel
down
so
well
where
did
all
that
music
come
from
the
veri
vibe
the
soul
of
those
song
come
from
a
place
those
youngster
couldn
t
have
experienc
yet
still
the
music
was
there
those
talent
brit
as
sterl
remark
sometim
it
just
isn
t
fair
how
talent
some
folk
are
but
hey
we
benefit
from
their
art
so
i
can
t
complain
too
much
and
as
much
as
