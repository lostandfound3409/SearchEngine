the
aveng
let’
talk
about
it
shall
we
i
have
mani
question
in
my
head
when
i
watch
it
in
the
cinema
alongsid
my
sister
and
brother
i
just
have
no
idea
whi
a
puni
useless
one
eye
director
nick
furi

in
charg
of
this
21st
power
ranger
team
so
call
the
aveng
what
doe
he
do
actual
give
play
card
to
toni
stark
to
boost
the
team’
spirit
he
is
useless
becaus
all
he
doe
is
actual
shoot
a
head
shot
on
level
guard
enemi
as
oppos
to
monster
and
alien
but
at
least
he’
not
dead
by
the
end
of
the
movi
honest
speak
when
i
watch
nick
furi
do
all
the
talk
all
i
can
hear
is
samuel
jackson
verbal
abus
and
curs
the
“motha
fuck
shit”
out
of
someon
throughout
the
movi
his
way
of
stare
other
actor
never
waver
in
everi
of
his
movi
perhap
the
glare
nostril
crazi
killer
eye
and
jag
mouth
while
talk
made
him
infam
of
have
this
charact
who
could
curs
ani
live
shit
on
earth
perhap
one
of
loki’
alien
armi
might
get
frighten
just
by
listen
to
nick’
curs
i’m
not
say
samuel
jackson
fail
to
win
the
audienc
by
play
nick
furi
in
fact
he
is
there
to
entertain
most
of
the
audienc
he
is
inde
a
funni
person
my
brother
and
i
can’t
stop
laugh
whenev
he
emerg
in
everi
scene
despit
his
mighti
serious
express
throughout
the
movi
it’
just
the
way
he
play
his
role
depict
a
black
senior
look
gangster
in
a
cool
leather
jacket
with
an
eye
patch
on
his
face
it’
just
phenomena
enough
of
nick
furi
let’
talk
about
thor
when
thor
jump
into
the
scene
by
a
light
cloud
while
iron
man
and
captain
america
hold
loki
in
this
jet
the
fight
scene
get
realli
intens
loki
is
be
interrog
by
thor
in
this
rocki
mountain
and
iron
man
tackl
thor
to
the
ground
while
loki
watch
from
up
abov
the
cinematographi
and
the
impact
sound
effect
are
mix
perfect
well
the
angl
they
shot
combin
it
with
great
cgi
i
honest
can’t
breath
at
that
time
i’m
sure
everyon
is
glu
to
this
scene
then
captain
america
throw
his
shield
and
quick
settl
the
short
quarrel
between
iron
man
and
thor
so
here’
my
question
to
thor
whi
is
he
look
for
loki
whatev
happen
to
natali
portman
aka
jane
foster
i
specif
rememb
that
jane
is
this
physician
correct
me
if
i’m
wrong
on
this
one
whom
thor
fall
in
love
with
then
when
thor
get
to
asgard
in
his
own
movi
he
promis
to
meet
jane
again
whi
the
meet
between
these
two
love
bird
are
halt
and
never
shown
that’
just
a
disappoint
in
my
part
same
as
captain
america
my
chest
itch
by
the
thought
of
steve
roger
aka
captain
america
who
can
not
go
back
to
his
ww2
era
and
blew
off
the
date
with
that
lieuten
girl
i
mean
it’
just
sad
to
be
a
superhero
that
can
not
be
with
someon
he
realli
love
although
in
the
last
scene
there’
this
civilian
who
get
a
glimps
of
captain
america

i
have
no
idea

hi…
i
appreci
you
call
yourself
‘apprentic
writer’
so
my
expect
were
not
too
high
in
read
this
that
said
i
would
like
to
give
you
some
construct
feedback
first
your
titl
you
ask
where
jane
foster
is
in
this
movi
well
her
pictur
portman
is
shown
as
phil
coulson
tell
thor
that
she
is
in
s
h
i
e
l
d
custodi
to
protect
her
from
loki
this
is
clear
state
so
though
she
doesn’t
appear
she
get
a
mention
to
be
fair
consid
your
titl
she
realli
onli
get
a
brief
one
short
paragraph
out
of
11
realli
long
one
mention
in
your
articl
so
you
can’t
realli
complain
i’m
sure
she
will
be
in
the
next
thor
movi
and
you’ll
get
to
see
them
make
out
plenti
but
this
movi
wasn’t
about
him
or
her…
it
was
an
aveng
movi
realli
the
clue
was
in
the
titl
i’m
also
sure
you’ll
get
to
see
captain
america
find
true
live
in
his
next
featur
hell
i
know
that’
the
onli
reason
i
go
to
see
comic
book
movi
not
for
adventur
not
for
fantasi
not
for
great
fight
scene
no
it’
all
about
the
kissi
kissi
right
that
bourn
legaci
guy
or
bourc
as
you
call
it
doesn’t
play
bourn
in
that
movi
this
is
just
one
of
the
mani
factual
inaccur
element
of
your
articl
it’

befor
you

someth
you
should
read
it
and
make
correct
i
was
go
to
point
them
all
out
but
it
would
be
embarrass
for
you
now
for
your
comparison
between
war
machin
and
nick
furi
actual
it’
the
actor
you
compar
i’m
still
tri
to
get
my
head
around
it
mayb
this
isn’t
your
intent
but
there
is
someth
in
there
that
come
over
as
latent
racism
it’
a
veri
strang
comment
to
make
a
actor
absent
from
the
film
paral
to
one
who
is
pure
on
the
basi
that
they
are
both
black
whi
your
final
comment
about
spiderman
has
me
perplex
he
appear
as
a
charact
in
veri
few
film
if
you
dislik
film
without
him
then
that
leav
onli
a
small
number
for
you
to
enjoy
as
such
i’m
not
convinc
you
are
best
place
to

actual
till
your

at

i

just
read
missymaycg’
comment
and
it
look
pretti
respect
and
construct
to
me
look
like
an
honest
opinion
come
from
an
avid
fan
of
these
type
of
movi
the
onli
reason
i
would
think
someon
would
be
hostil
toward
it
is
becaus
they
feel
threaten
i
also
read
ellokai’
about
me
page
and
i
think
he
is
just
stick
to
what
he
know
best
which
is
law
i
see
lawyer
as
peopl
who
have
to
be
200
confid
at
all
time
becaus
they
must
demand
respect
to
make
a
live
that
be
said
he
is
a
bit
out
of
his
element
by
review
a
movi
whose
audienc
is
so
broad
that
it
would
be
kind
of
hard
to
display
your
domin
over

he
is
even
more
wrong
to
have
“jane

appear
more

than
in

sad
not
