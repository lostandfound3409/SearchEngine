about

as
well
as

it
is
also
simpli
a
damn
good
stori
by
a
damn
good
storytel
i
have
a
difficult
time
write
review
about
book
that
i
ador
becaus
when
i
m
not
read
them
i
hug
them
too
close
to
be

critic
btw
i
frequent
hug
a
tale
of
two
citi
in
front
of
my
student
and
write
charl
dicken
name
with
heart
around
it
they
think
i
m
crazi
but
it
intrigu
some
of
them
just
enough
to
make
them
doubt
the
deris
comment
of
upperclassmen
i
reluct
admit
that
dicken
doe
oversimplifi
the
caus
of
the
french
revolut
and
the
reign
of

howev
in
do
so
he
success
captur
the
spirit
of
a
tumultu
period
and
help
reader
sympath
with
charact
on
everi
side
of
the
develop
conflict
i
also
think
that
the
charact
of
roger
cli
and
john
barsad
get
a
bit
messi
and
may
have
work
better
as
a
singl
charact
perhap
the
confus
is
a
result
of
serial
restructur
but
realli
i
read
a
tale
of
two
citi
like
a
costum

fan
at

i
cheer
when
my

i

laugh
when

i
don

three

i
had
no

as
to
what
a
tale
of
two
citi
was
about
i
read
on
the
back
cover
that
dicken
himself
believ
it
to
be
the
greatest
stori
he
d
ever
written
so
i
figur
if
i
tri
and
just
couldn

do
it
then
it
would
probabl
be
over
between
me
and
him
as
you
may
have
notic
from
my
rate
i
had
a
great
one
am
pleas
to
say
that
i
will
now
open
the
next
dicken
on
the
list
with
a
littl
eager
expect
yes
there
were
long
patch
of
dens
prose
but
they
realli
weren
t
too
bad
probabl
becaus
i
find
the
content
fascin
the
storm
of
the
bastill
and
the
terror
horrif
both
on
the
part
of
the
nobil
pre
revolut
and
the
citizen
of
the
republ
incred
well
written
and
utter
engag
i
actual
enjoy
read
the
page
describ
the
time
the
imageri
use
to
describ
it
the
sea
of
black
and
threaten
water
that
roll
in
wave
after
wave
etc
and
you
ve
got
ta
love
classic
british
dri
wit
satir
demonstr
perfect
in
the
first
half
of
the
chapter
monseigneur
in
town
a
problem
i
have
with
mani
classic
with
except
like
the
count
of
mont
cristo
which
i
just
could
not
put
down
is
that
the
pace
is
all
over
the
show
i
was
just
not
that
interest
in
all
the
time
spent
in
england
ride
on
train
and
get
marri
etc
the
real
stori
was
in
franc
with
madam
monsieur
defarg
or
at
least
that
s
what
i
found
the
most
interest
to
me
the
pace
began
to
lag
from
about
half
way
through
until
about
the
last
100
page
where
it
pick
up
dramat
as
soon
as
sydney
carton
came
on
the
scene
toward
the
end
i
could
pick
the
outcom
probabl
becaus
the
last
line
is
so
well
known
it
is
a
far
far
better
thing
that
i
do
than
i
have
ever
done
etc
nevertheless
i
couldn
t
wait
to
see
how
it
play
out
i
wasn
t
disappoint
yay
so
i
am
pleas
to
say
that
i
have
made
up
with
dicken
and
now
glad
welcom
recommend
for
the

abil
to
craft
larger

charact
whose
defin

trait
and
convers
tic
carri
them
strong
through
the
stori
and
his
depict
of
franc
befor
and
dure
the
revolut
is
as
vivid
and
bloodi
as
the
terror
despit
his
exercis
all
the
expect
victorian
restraint
when
it
come
to
actual
describ
bloodsh
he
also
contrast
pari
with
london
and
not
alway
in
london
s
favor
dicken
was
a
marvel
social
critic
of
his
time
and
with
underst
clariti
he
show
the
reader
how
while
the
british
aristocraci
was
no
longer
trampl
peasant
beneath
their
hors
feet
with
impun
the
english
court
system
was
hard
more
just
or
less
rapaci
and
corrupt
than
the
french
the
reader
can
be
forgiven
for
think
it
s
just
a
histor
novel
about
the
french
revolut
and
the
thrill
escap
of
some
of
it
would
be
victim
dicken
tell
us
what
the
novel
is
realli
about
in
the
last
chapter
and
yet
there
is
not
in
franc
with
it
rich
varieti
of
soil
and
climat
a
blade
a
leaf
a
root
a
sprig
a
peppercorn
which
will
grow
to
matur
under
condit
more
certain
than
those
that
have
produc
this
horror
crush
human
out
of
shape
onc
more
under
similar
hammer
and
it
will
twist
itself
into
the
same
tortur
form
sow
the
same
seed
of
rapaci
licens
and
oppress
over
again
and
it
will
sure
yield
the
same
fruit
accord
to
it
kind
the
stori
itself
is
typic
dickensian
in
that
it
is
full
of
memor
charact
who
are
all
brought
onstag
separ
and
then
brought
togeth
by
a
tighten
web
of

thread
that
end
up

everyon

one

anoth

dicken
introduc
a

he
mean
to
use
that
charact
until
the
veri
end

will
use
ani
improb
plot
devic
to
make
sure
everyon

to

face

dure
that
london
trial

it
all
work
to
creat
a
tens
and
veri
enjoy
novel
one
of
my
chief
complaint
about
dicken
besid
his
overus
of
coincid
is
his
veri
victorian
view
of
women
alway
angel
of
one
kind
or
anoth
whether
fallen
or
still
high
on
their
pedest
but
he
almost
redeem
himself
of
that
in
this
book
with
his
angel
of
death
madam
defarg
and
her
sidekick
the
vengeanc
one
of
the
scariest
ladi
in
british
literatur
and
the
final
confront
between
madam
defarg
and
miss
pross
was
all
the
more
epic
for
that
dicken
so
rare
resolv
a
situat
with
a
scene
of
violenc
and
this
time
he
did
it
with
two
bad
ass
women
both
of
them
practic
wave
their
nation

as
they
went
at
each
other

general
gist
of
the
outcom
they
show
dicken
as
the
consumm
stori
teller
that
he
is
and
a
master
rhetorician
the
stand
off
between
miss
pross
and
mme
defarg
is
absolut
stun
in
it
tell
and
as
it
reveal
dicken
choic
about
how
to
tell
an
import
part
of
the
end
how
to
bring
to
complet
the
theme
of
loyalti
friendship
and
love
the
posit
and

give
power
of
allegi
to
an

as
oppos
to

knew
full

that

the
famili

devot
friend
miss
pross
knew
full
well
that
madam
defarg
was
the
famili
s
malevol
enemi
it
was
in
vain
for
madam
defarg
to
struggl
and
to
strike
miss
pross
with
the
vigor
tenac
of
love
alway
so
much
stronger
than
hate
clasp
her
tight
and
even
lift
her
from
the
floor
in
the
struggl
that
they
had
my
underlin
i
just
love
that
phrase
the
vigor
tenac
of
love
there
is
someth
even
of
paradis
lost
here
there
is
someth
on
that
grand
a
scale
in
depict
the
fight
between
good
and
evil
among
so
mani
dualiti
set
up
from
that
absolut
extraordinari
begin
paragraph
that
mani
of
us
can
quot
by
heart
and
the
titl
itself
good
and
evil
love
and
hate
life
and
death
is
what
this
book
come
down
to
there
is
also
an
acknowledg
of
the
grey
area
between
the
polar
there
is
an
understand
that
evil
peopl
are
do
evil
act
but
that
these
are
foment
within
a
social
and
histor
context
crush
human
out
of
shape
onc
more
under
similar
hammer
and
it
will
twist
itself
into
the
same
tortur
form
sow
the
same
seed
of
rapaci
licenc
and
oppress
over
again
and
it
will
sure
yield
the
same
fruit
accord
to
it
kind
it
s
veri
big
themat
histor
and
yet
it
s
also
veri
for
dicken
concis
that
combin
is
extrem
potent
and
probabl
the
central
reason
i
love
it
so
much
someth
els
to
be
said
is
the
relat
absenc
of
humour
or
caricatur
as
is
common
in
dicken
with
the
except
of
jerri
cruncher
dicken
with
again
that
precis
use
jerri
throughout
the
novel
as
a
charact
that
unit
and
advanc
the
plot
in
specif
way
at
specif
point
but
he
also
allow
him
to
evolv
and
grow
in
a
way
that
he
doesn
t
alway
even
in
bleak
hous
i
notic
this
time
round
that
dicken
has
the
jaw
drop
audac
to
insert
what
is
i
believ
the
onli

scene
in

and
jerri
tri
to
make

jerri
s

right
befor
it
most
tragic
and
it
is
funni
and
a
few
page
later
those

to

this
is
incred
write
the
dualiti

the

he
did
make
it
veri

what
were
her
reason
for
behav
so
ruthless
toward
the
famili
to
wish
and
work
for
their

but
i
think
ultim
he
didn
t
leav
her
with
that
ground
to
stand
on
to
excus
her
action
esp
becaus
he
set
up
the
how
far
is
too
far
argument
and
contrast
her
with
her
husband
who
was
about
to
or
would
she
fear
show
merci
he
put
her
in
the
same
camp
and
describ
her
as
even
more
extrem
than
jacqu

the
vengeanc
both
of
whom
were
prepar

kill

of
a
chapter

her
psycholog
i
don
t
have
the
book
with

in
modern

parlanc
she
was
a

no

capabl
of
no

no
piti
and
wouldn

expect

use

in

the

dicken
is
brilliant
i
don
t
care
if
he
got
paid
by
the
word
i
don
t
care
if
he
take
a
whole
chapter
to
describ
a
charact
his
verbos
is
my
weak
and
i
constant
learn
from
him
for
anyon
who
has
read
dicken
you
know
that
the
coin
phrase
dickinsonian
charact
is
high
accur
the
depth
he
goe
to
make
us
fall
in
love
with
them
and
his
talent
for
give
them
name
that
describ
their
charact
so
accur
is
sure
one
of
his
greatest
talent
and
should
be
alway
note
in
his
work
i
have
also
note
anoth
trait
that
i
can
not
so
easili
put
into
word
it
s
almost
as
if
his
stori
are
soap
opera
and
i
use
this
term
loos
becaus
it
seem
so
derogatori
but
in
the
way
that
you
never
quit
know
what
to
expect
the
stori
might
at
first
seem
straightforward
and
the
plot
simpl
but
then
when
you
least
expect
it
new
clue
are
releas
and
each
of
the
charact
becom
intertwin
in
a
way
you
least
expect
so
much
so
that
by
the
end
of
the
book
the
action
of
each
of
the
charact
carri
so
much
more
weight
i
see
this
in
mani
of
his
book
and
wish
i
could
come
up
with
an
adject
to
describ
it
if
anyon
has
simpl
word
or
sentenc
from
their
own
repertoir
to
describ
this
pleas
share
it
with
me
besid
the
obvious
charact
depth
and
plot
build
aptitud
dicken
rous
everi
major
emot
of
mankind
into
this
tale
at
first
i
thought
it
was
most
about
the
love
triangl
wasn
t
this
suppos
to
be
about
the
french
revolut
but
just
when
i
was
get
exasper
with
the
stori
line
it
explod
into
so
much
more
the
theme
of
the
human
condit
dicken
expound
upon
are
vast
from
love
to
bitter
from
reveng
to
heroism
from
sacrific
to
friendship
and
back
to
love
again
he
touch
upon
them
all
of
the
mani
theme
this
novel
touch
i
think
my
favorit
is
that
of
imprison
there
are
the
obvious
charact
such
as
manett
and
darnay
which
are
actual
sent
to
jail
but
then
there
are
other
that
are
imprison
by
other
thing
in
their
life
lorri
seem
unnatur
tie
to
tellson
s
bank
darnay
is
tri
to
escap
his
past
and
of
cours
carton
who
is
trap
by
his
restless
this
struggl
of
man
vers
natur
is
also
seen
in
echo
of
other
scene
such
as
manett
s
attempt
with
let
go
of
his
time
in
prison
as
he
make
his
shoe
the
memori
of
his
time
there
still
tortur
him
and
luci
s
habit
of
sit
in
her
parlor
as
she
hear
the
echo
of
the
footstep
in
the
street
bring
a
forebod
of
what
s
yet
to
come
combin
with
the
mingl
of
her
person
battl
and
the
polit
conflict
of
the
age
this
theme
is
a
person
one
for
me
becaus
of
event
i
ve
endur
dure
my
life
as
well
as
how
much
easier
i
can
relat
to
a
charact
becaus
of
it
i
can
t
speak
to
them
all
becaus
i
d
be
write
a
book
but
this
stori
cover
almost
all
of
the
major
theme
in
literatur
man
struggl
against
natur
overcom
advers
death
be
part
of
the
life
cycl
and
of
cours
sacrific
are
just
some
of
them
i
also
love
learn
new
word
and
dicken
never
fail
to
disappoint
me
there
prevar
and
tergivers
were
two
of
my
favorit
the
onli
fault
that
i
could
see
with
this
book
were
two
dicken
s
loquaci
and
his
predilect
for
flat
femal
lead
i
ve
alreadi
discuss
my
love
of
his
verbos
so
those
peopl
out
there
who
want
shorter
book
well
go
read
the
twilight
saga
and
as
for
his
insipid
femal
charact
well
these
innocu
be
are
more
than
forgiven
when
take
into
consider
his
resplend
femal
charact
that
come
along
everi
onc
in
a
while
such
as
madam
defarg
in
tale
of
two
citi
or
miss
havisham
in
great
expect
so
overal
i
truli
enjoy
read
this
book
even
though
i
was
impati
to
see
the
action
start
a
littl
quicker
but
his
write
is
so
eloqu
i
soon
forgot
my
misgiv
and
got
lost
in
this
novel
dicken
is
a
brilliant
writer
one
of
my
favorit
and
so
differ
than
anyth
i
ve
ever
read
i
like
him
better
than
austen
or
shakespear
or
ani
other
classicist
i
ve
read
thus
far
i
m
so
reliev
that
he
wrote
so
mani
book
that
i
can
continu
to
enjoy
him
for
a
veri
long
time
i
high
recommend
this
book
and
leav
you
with
anoth
passag
that
touch
me
for
the
first
time
the
doctor
felt
now
that
his
suffer
was
strength
and
power
for
the
first
time
he
felt
that
in
that
sharp
fire
he
had
slowli
forg
the
iron

what

thereâ€™
someth
beyond
what
realli

work
that
i
canâ€™t
quit
get
at
mayb
on
my
fourth

fifth
read
i
will
have
nestl
into
what
i
canâ€™t
quit
get
but
until
then
i
will
have
to
reli
on
someth
contrari
to
my
instinct
the
thing
that
put
me
off
but
then
ultim
make
the
stori
what
it
is
is
this
imag
of
the
shi
humbl
nuclear
famili
â€“
the
blond
girl
name
luci
and
the
unassum
faceless
father
the
easiest
shorthand
for
good
the
celesti
angel
that
is
not
my
god
and
even
though
i
mistrust
it
deepli
â€“
i
mistrust
it
to
whatev
marrow
up
the
marrow
of
my
bone
â€“
it
make
sens
for
what
it
is
in
this
stori
it
is
a
symbol
for
someth
not
grasp
about
human
a
symbol
for
someth
that
wish
happi
not
destruct
on
peopl
and
that
doe
seem
like
a
symbol
of
good
to
me
even
if
it
trap
are
soak
in
the
suspici
where
to
me
the
darnay
manett
famili
is
code
for
abus
and
for
valu
secur
over
integr
the
apologet
wife
who
so
desper
crave
her
husbandâ€™
affect
that
she
pretend
helpless
the
husband
who
grovel
to
his
father
in
law
and
otherwis
has
no
remark
person
trait
for
dicken
it
was
not
that
and
i
can
see
it
and
respect
what
he
was
do
here
i
donâ€™t
know
mayb
i
donâ€™t
think
a
hope
famili
has
been
written
just
like
i
havenâ€™t
seen
a
real
life
famili
that
would
fit
me
right
but
where
the
girl
action
hero
is
a
symbol
of
hope
to
me
i
can
see
how
luci
manett
is
a
symbol
of
hope
in
revers
of
that
but
not
in
a
bad
way
she
is
a
symbol
of
â€œwhat
if
peopl
were
generous
and
she
doe
not
realli
have
enough
contrast
to
be
an
interest
charact
but
she
in
herself
is
a
contrast
becaus
is
this
book
about
her
or
is
about
madam
defarg
realli
it
is
about
neither
and
the
one
is
onli
a
contrast
to
the
other
madam
defarg
is
more
interest
to
me
knit
reveng
but
luci
is
still
function
and
she
still
has
mean
she
is
the
innoc
that
a
person
save
if
we
can
but
back
to
our
god
the
various
chorus
run
through
this
book
of
sacrific
and
resurrect
execut
and
reveng
wove
togeth
with
the
worship
of
the
god
clean
and
in
a
way
that
reson
with
me
and
made
me
think
about
how
our
action
reveal
what
god
we
worship
if
we
today
could
call
our
god
by
the
help
honest
name
of
the
ancient
â€“

freedom

i

i
think
you
have
a
point
that
i
may
have
exagger
the
extent
of
differ
of
opinion
we
have
on
this
matter
perhap
my
take
was
base
more
on
someth
i
felt
was
implicit
in
your
review
rather
than
explicit
the
fact
is
the
locus
of
power
in
the
manett
darnay
famili
lie
firm
within
the
father
s
grasp
although
he
doesn
t
abus
this
power
from
my
marxist
perspect
i
m
not
a
marxist
per
se
but
i
find
marxist
analysi
particular
relev
to
this
book
this
manett
darnay
patriarchi
was
a
firm
entrench
aspect
of
the
class
system
that
the
leader
of
the
french
revolut
were
tri
to
overturn
becaus
let
s
face
it
when
there
is
such
an
imbal
of
power
in
ani
relationship
in
most
case
that
power
will
be
abus
whether
on
the
scale
of
famili
or
nation
i
think
your
notion
of
the
suburban
is
realli
interest
too
becaus
ultim
from
a
marxist
perspect
the
idea
of
this
suburban
pictur
perfect
famili
is
a
bourgeoi
patriarchi
the
primari
purpos
of
the
suburban
famili
unit
is
to
communic
and
perpetu
oneâ€™
own
class
status
you
canâ€™t
afford
to
live
in
the
suburb
unless
you
have
money
the
â€œpictur
famili
is
the
faã§ad
all
suburbanit
must
hide
behind
so
as
to
not
endang
their
class
posit
if
your
neighbor
knew
you
were
beat
your
kid
and
wife
they
would
probabl
find
you
too
distast
to
live
next
to
your
co
worker
has
those
pictur
of
his
famili
so
that
peopl
will
think
heâ€™
a
good
guy
he
may
be
one
or
he
may
not
be
but
the
pictur
are
there
to
protect
his
imag
so
his
sourc
of
incom
and
bourgeoi
comfort
will
not
be
threaten
you
notic
in
cinema
of
the
past
20
year
and
further
back
depict
of
the
lower
class
do
not
general
have
these
kind
of
â€œpictur
pretens
most
becaus
poor
folk
donâ€™t
have
to
keep
up
this
hypocrisi
at
least
not
to
the
same
degre
becaus
they
donâ€™t
have
as
much
to
lose
if
they
donâ€™tâ€™
keep
it
up
one
of
my
favorit
line
from
macbeth
is
when
malcolm
say
to
i
think
donalbain
that
â€œthough
all
thing
foul
would
wear
the
brow
of
grace
yet
grace
must
still
look
so
i
think
in
the
case
of
manett
darnay
famili
dicken
want
us
to
believ
they
are
one
of
the
few
peopl
who
not
onli
wear
the
brow
of
grace
but
actual
have
it
in
their
heart
they
are
the
rare
exampl
of
â€œbenevol
anyway
iâ€™m
not
sure
how
much
of
this
make
sens
and
i
realli
apolog
if

unpleas

sinc
you

you

i
have
to

i

are
the
flat

further
although
it
has
the

the

this
is
not

for

inform
as
i
move
into

iii
the
pace
pick
up
consider
although
i
still
had
difficulti
with
the
implaus
of
part
of
the
narrat
and
coincid
which
made
me
want
to
roll
my
eye
and
then
it
happen
the
narrat
had
a
major
inject
of
suspens
which
kept
me
glu
to
my
ipod
until
the
end
and
when
the
novel
end
i
wept
actual
i
came
pretti
close
to
sob
even
though
i
knew
what
was
go
to
happen
and
had
known
from
the
begin
i
love
it
when
a

make
me
cri
that
reaction
come

it
did
at
the
veri
end
overshadow
the
weak
which
i
thought
would
stop
me
love
the
work
dicken
is
not
go
to
becom
my

he
won
t
even

victorian
writer
as
i
much
prefer
the
work
of

been

that
there
had
been
a

more
of

howev
whatev
the
weak
in

charact
and
the
write
the
dual
theme
of
love
and
sacrific
â€“
and
the
final
scene
will
remain
with
me
for
a
long
time
and
dicken
made
me
cri
which
has
tip
my
rate
of
the
novel
from

a

i
might
add
from

both
young
and

in

of
my

both
past

you
alway
came
across
to
me
as
someon
who
were
to
be
conquer
and
i
guess
i
was
afraid
of
been
vanquish
this
would
probabl
be
a

of

one
would
think
of
take
up
with

you
remain
quit

me

instal

don

let
that
stop
you
there
s
a
reason
that
charl
dicken
is
one
of
the
most
popular
storytel
and
this
particular
novel
is
world
s
bestsel
work
of

at

dicken
s

eman
pure
beauti
that
s
so
miss
in

while
i
enjoy
read
literatur
that
deal
with
the
ambigu

uncertain
of
contemporari
life
and
the
human
natur
i
also
enjoy
read
work
that
begin
and
end
with
everyth
solv
clear
and
with
sens
and
what
a
begin
this
book
has
and
what
an
end
i
dare
to
say
that
both
the
open
and
close
scene
are
some
of
the
most
beauti
i
ve
ever
read
in
some
of
the
most
power
and
evoc
prose
ever
written
dicken
has
creat
a
broad
cast
of
charact
of
two
nation
and
multipl
social
class
and
polit
affili
and
effortless
weav
their
stori
but
the
real
topic
of
this
book
is
love
the
power
of
love
make
us
human
but
it
also
give
us
power
to
do
thing
that
we
would
never
dream
of
do
it
s
an
encompass
of
braveri
devot
and
dedic
that
give
ordinari
peopl
strenght
of
such
calib
that
allow
us
to
be
more
than
human
i
too
believ
that
in

end
love
is
one
of
the
few
thing
that
matter
but
don

listen
to
me
read

it
is
nice
to

an

grab
his

without

explos

i
wish

today
could

use

to
set
a
tone

place
the
reader
into
a
mindset
to
appreci
his
stori
i
am
mind
that
this
book
was
written
onli
60
or
so
year
after
the
terribl
event
of
pari
in
the
earli
1790s
it
was
the
best
of
time
there
was
so
much
chang
and
much
of
it
for
the
better
but
it
was
also
the
worst
of
time
the
social
upheav
the
innoc
murder
wholesal
the
end
was
magnific
as
well
the
tension
of
the
trial
was
pain
and
the
wicked
of
madam
defarg
resolv
itself
with
the
sacrific
and
redempt
of
sydney
carton
it
is
a
far
far
better
thing
that
i
do
than
i
have
ever
done
it
is
a
far
far
better
rest
that
i
go
to
than
i
have
ever
known
wow
and
then
carton
goe
off
to
see
ladi

what
an
end
it

onli

at

beauti

that
it
the

i

the

is
also
a

choppi
i
don

it
s
simpli
a
matter
of
adjust
to
his
style
of
english
i
think
his
prose
smooth
out
consider
after
the
first
few
chapter
he
also
has
this
annoy
tendenc
toward
intent
obtus
the
techniqu

pay

but
most
it
s
just
frustrat
as
a

to

him

what
the

he
s
talk
about
but
all
quibbl
asid
a

his

is

he
himself
use

how
to

i

convinc
that

he
would
have
been
an

and
though
the
novel
is
set
within
and
inextric
link
to
the
french
revolut
it
is
not
about
the
french

that

is
