at
9
00
am
when
i
was
in
fifth
grade
my
dad
gave
me
a
big
stack
of
classic
book
that
in
retrospect
i
was
probabl
too
young
to
read
on
christma
morn
i
rip
open
watership
down
billi
budd
mobi
dick
and
the
catcher
in
the
rye
a
book
i
end
up
read
voraci
albeit
with
a
bit
of
confus
i
couldn’t
possibl
have
understood
the
complex
of
holden
caulfield
and
sure
some
of
holden’
adventur
like
call
a
prostitut
went
over
my
head
it
was
certain
the
first
book
i
read
with
the
f
word
i
specif
rememb
the
part
where
holden
is
shock
after
his
prostitut
say
“like
fun
”
and
i
rememb
wonder
what
was
wrong
with
that
what
a
cool
say
like
fun
i
will
never
forget
open
those
books—it
was
the
catalyst
of
my
love
relationship
with
read
i’m
glad
i
was
expos
to
the
catcher
in
the
rye
at
such
a
young
age
it’
one
of
those
book
that’
worthi
of
a
good
read
everi
few
year
at
differ
stage
in
your
life
the
last
time
i
read
it
at
age
27
i
was
struck
by
how
young
and
immatur
holden
seem
when
i
read
the
same
book
as
an
elementari
school
student
he
seem
old
and
wise
i’m
not
sure
all
parent
would
invit
their
10
year
old
to
read
salinger’
classic
work
i
can
rememb
the
surpris
on
my
teachers’
face
when
they
heard
what
i
got
for
christma
and
now
as
i’m
older
i
start
wonder
at
what
age
i
would
buy
my
kid
the
book
mayb
we’d
read
it
togeth
as
a
bedtim
stori
mayb
i’d
wait
until
they
were
teenag
mayb
i’d
follow
suit
and
gift
my
10
year
old
a
stack
of
matur
classic
kind
of
like
a
welcom
to
read
introductori
packag
some
parent
might
never
consid
buy
it
for
their
kid
and
for
some
10
might
not
be
soon
enough
what
do
you
think
is
the
best
age
to
buy
