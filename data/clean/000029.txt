everyon

i
fulli
agre
the
reason
for

we
all

of
the

to
be
by
the
far
one
of
the
greatest
work
of
write
of
the
20th
centuri
it
is
all
a
game
we
play
with
tolkien
for
he
too
took
it
much
more
serious
then
ani
other
fantasi
of
scienc
fiction
writer
ever
has
he
made
up
languag
that
exist
in
relationship
to
languag
and
dialect
that
we
have
in
english
and
thus
creat
a
nightmar
for
translat
he
told
stori
of
all
sort
of
peril
of
creation
and
made
sure
everyth
was
done
right
thus
when
an
edit
like
this
come
out
it
is
truli
pain
for

tolkien
creat
some
of
the
most
