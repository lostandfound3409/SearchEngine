this
is
just
a
note
to
say
bewar
of
the
new
translat
if
you
ve
previous
read
and
enjoy
the
katherin
wood
version
mr
howard
make
the
argument
in
his
translat
s
note
that
the
languag
has
chang
sinc
the
1940
s
and
that
a
new
translat
is
need
i
couldn
t
disagre
more
and
i
do
speak
with
some
experi
on
this
subject
i
read
this
titl
at
school
in
the
origin
french
languag
for
three
differ
class
as
well
as
numer
time
in
english
the
wood
version
katherin
wood
beauti
captur
the
feel
of
the
french
origin
the
new
howard
translat
is
in
a
more
modern
english
which
most
succeed
at
remov
the
poetri
that
previous
exist
and
littl
els
that
i
can
find
it
doe
not
make
the
stori
ani
more
clear
or
nuanc
than
it
previous
was
rather
less
so
i
find
the
argument
for
a
new
translat
indefenc
three
star
is
not
a
review
of
the
book
but
of
the
translat
this
titl
is
beyond
excel
but
you
might
do
yourself
a
favor
and
find
a
use
copi
with
the
wood
translat
there
are

copi
