not

among

he
thought
it
wise
to
take
me
with
him
so
that
i
might
know
the
wonder
of
itali
and
be
present
when
the

but
the

then
absorb

myself
i
roam
among
the
citi
of
tuscani
part
out
of

and
part
out
of
a
desir
to
learn
but
this
undisciplin
freedom
my
parent
thought
was
not
suitabl
for
an
adolesc
devot
to
a
contempl

and
on
the
advic
of
marsilius
who
had
taken
a
like
to
me
they
decid
to
place
me
under
the
direct

about

i
did
not
then
know
what
brother
william
was
seek
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
still
do
not
know
today
and
i
presum
he
himself
did
not
know
move
as
he
was
sole
by
the
desir
for
truth
and
by
the
suspicionâ€‰â€”â€‰which
i
could
see
he
alway
harboredâ€‰â€”â€‰that
the

was
not
what
was

him
at

with

william
had

unknown
to
me
while

rather
he
never

to
me
about

it
was
onli
by
overhear
bit
of
his
convers

the

we
stop
along

our

the
magnific
descript

the
histor
context
in
which
this

took
place
in
but
especi
the
idea
express
in

book
were
the
element
that
made
this
book
superior
from
the

to
such
a
level
that
a
movi
was
made
to
fulfil
the
vast
excel

although
the
movi
is
not

the

when
they
wrote

all
the
