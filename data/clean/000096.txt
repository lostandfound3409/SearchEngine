note
i
wish
i
could
have
found
an
imag
of
the
cover
of
the
edit
of
this
book
i
actual
read
i
found
it
at
the
book
swap
in
my
offic
and
it
a
1980s
movi
tie
in
edit
with
sean
connery’
face
on
the
front
yeah
it’
pretti
spectacular
alright
so
“the
name
of
the
rose”
was
appar
umberto
eco’
first
novel
and
it
was
the
thing
to
read
upon
it’
initi
releas
the
stori
of
brother
william
who
wind
up
investig
the
mysteri
death
of
sever
monk
captiv
reader
and
was
made
into
a
movi
star
sean
conneri
f
murray
abraham
and
a
young
christian
slater
from
the
synopsi
and
the
hype
i
figur
it’d
be
a
good
read
have
finish
it
i’m
a
littl
disappoint
i
want
it
to
be
better
though
there
are
definit
solid
element
–
eco
write
in
gorgeous
detail
about
everi
inch
of
the
monasteri
–
the
whole
thing
drag
there’
the
inquisit
and
underground
tunnel
and
sex
and
the
whole
thing
revolv
around
clever
place
poison
and
a
book
so
the
fact
that
it’
kind
of
a
snore
is
serious
disappoint
brother
william
is
a
sherlock
holm
esqu
charact
who’
obvious
well
develop
and
incred
smart
but
it’
a
shame
the
mysteri
he’
charg
with
solv
isn’t
more
interest
that
said
the
movi
stream
on
netflix
and
i’m
plan
to
watch
it
soon
mayb
in
the
hand
of
a
good
director
thing
can
be
snip
and
swap
and
a
