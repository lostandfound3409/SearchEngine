–
see
all
my
review
first
and
foremost
i
am
a
guy
which
in
most
case
mean
i
did
not
go
see
titan
to
see
dicaprio
although
i
think
he
can
be
a
great
actor
read
through
earlier
comment
i
grew
a
bit
weari
of
hear
about
lame
script
and
shallow
charact
i
went
to
see
a
ship
sink
the
plot
and
the
charact
were
at
least
to
me
a
kind
of
ice
on
the
cake
i
actual
think
a
lot
of
the
charact
were
done
well
that
is
by
the
time
they
die
in
freez
water
you
actual
felt
a
ting
of
sad
for
them
but
by
the
time
titan
was
over
i
was
suffici
move
to
make
me
tell
peopl
that
it
was
a
great
movi
