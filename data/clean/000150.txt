that
it
would
fail

live
up
to
it
predecessor
the
old
lesson
hollywood
never
learn
make
thing
bigger
and
flashier
doesn
t
alway
mean
it
will
be
better
the
plot
oh
geez
where
to
begin
this
is
the
main
issu
with
this
franchis
which
begun
in
this
sequel
onli
to
get
wors
in
the
third
film
the
stori
becom
so
convolut
and
twisti
it
hard
to
keep
up
and
this
is
a
disney
film
put
veri
simpli
most
of
the
charact
are
all
after
various
bit
n
piec
includ
davi
jone
heart
sparrow
s
compass
and
the
black
pearl
each
charact
has
their
own
reason
for
need
each
item
and
most
of
these
reason
intertwin
with
each
other
at
some
point
oh
and
old
charact
come
back
into
the
fray
the
plot
is
the
first
film
was
pretti
straight
forward
i
m
not
say
simpl
is
best
but
it
was
easi
to
swallow
this
film
kick
off
relat
well
with
the
charact
we
know
in
troubl
for
help
sparrow
a
deal
is
set
a
plan
underway
and
everybodi
know
who

i
can

in

it
is

and
when
you
think
about
it
it
quit
good
so
onc
you
ve
got
your
head
around
the
plot
you
do
tend
to
notic
how
big
everyth
has
becom
the
prison
sparrow
escap
from
at
the
start
look
veri
similar
to
some
kind
of
fortress
you
d
expect
to
see
in
a
tolkien
stori
the
entir
earli
cannib
infest
island
part
of
the
film
realli
doe
show
how
the
franchis
took
a
swing
for
the
worst
sparrow
norrington
and
turner
break
out
into
a
three
way
fight
over
jone
chest
which
last
for
at
least
10
15
minut
display
way
way
too
much
slapstick
complet
unbeliev
cartoon
stunt
that
detach
you
from
the
film
and
the
trio
end
up
cover
half
the
island
whilst
battl
in
short
the
whole
sequenc
wasn
t
need
it
was
complet
overblown
and
mere
flashi
filler
it
bare
no
import
to
the
plot
whatsoev
and
this
is
what
you
will
come
to
expect
from
the
franchis
thereaft
now
of
cours
we
know
this
franchis
is
a
comedi
of
sort
a
period
set
comedi
action
thriller
for
everyon
to
enjoy
the
first
film
had
a
nice
balanc
of
that
plus
some
supernatur
fantasi
that
realli
work
well
this
sequel
ad
that
horrend
cartoonish
hijinx
that
total
tore
you
away
from
ani
suspens
of
disbelief
becaus
it
went
beyond
that
into
a
pure
hokey
farc
on
top
of
the
ludicr
tomfooleri
now
on
show
this
film
has
easili
had
much
more
creativ
influenc
from
the
classic
videogam
the
secret
of
monkey
island
if
you
know
the
game
it
quit
plain
to
see
realli
the
cannib
island
at
the
start
the
murki
misti
swampi
locat
where
the
team
meet
voodoo
priestess
tia
dalma
and
of
cours
that
charact
in
her
entireti
plus
the
similar
jone
has
to
lechuck
in
term
of
evil
behaviour
the
supernatur
and
look
it
is
a
shame
becaus
the
film
is
a
good
fantasi
with
some
gorgeous
visual
both
cgi
and
real
time
davi
jone
and
his
crew
are
incred
a
real
sight
to
behold
especi
jone
squid
like
face
of
cours
it
amaz
to
actual
see
cgi
that
look
so
good
you
think
it
a
real

job
the
other

member
are
also
so
vivid

and
well
craft
everi
scene
with

dog
was
realli
great

i
realli

the

it
was
given
much
like
the
pearl
and
it
ghost
shroud
of
mist
n
fog
and
of
cours
the
kraken
was
a
fun
nautic
myth
to
includ
if
somewhat
unorigin
and
not
too
good
on
the
cgi
front
it
still
a
fun
film
which
is
save
by
the
british
actor
and
their
astound
fun
well
spoken
pompos
that
and
the
excel
effect
on
jone
and
his
undead

the
final
for

is
an
excit
cliffhang
even
though
you
know
he
will
be
back
it

to
see
a

bicker
and

cross
each

instead
of
