the
da
vinci
code
the
truth
behind
the
code
when
i
took
the
decis
of
sit
down
and
read
the
book
it
was
becaus
of
the
high
recommend
that
it
had
receiv
from
all
my
friend
and
teacher
i
myself
am
not
much
of
a
reader
but
as
soon
as
i
start
read
the
book
i
just
couldn
t
let
go
of
it
after
read
this
book
i
can
certain
say
that
dan
brown
is
a
true
genius
the
da
vinci
code
is
a
masterpiec
it
s
one
of
those
book
that
are
uniqu
and
that
are
alway
go
to
be
a
must
read
it
start
out
with
a
murder
case
but
it
isn
t
your
typic
case
of
find
out
who
it
is
dan
brown
is
sure
of
leav
more
than
evid
toward
the
true
secret
behind
this
murder
case
that
has
more
behind
it
than
just
a
guilti
assassin
i
assur
you
that
throughout
the
whole
journey
that
the
protagonist
robert
langdon
and
sophi
nevu
undergo
you
will
feel
the
tension
and
the
passion
for
find
out
the
secret
that
da
vinci
has
left
for
us
you
will
feel
nervous
you
will
feel
sad
and
disappoint
when
you
can
t
find
out
the
secret
and
you
will
utter
satisfact
you
will
end
up
with
an
open
mouth
it
has
all
the
characterist
of
a
mysteri
adventur
novel
that
will
make
you
enjoy
this
book
as
if
you
re
robert
of
sophi
themselv
i
m
certain
that
you
won
t
be
abl
to
think
about
anyth
els
when
you
re
not
read
the
book
besid
all
this
incred
characterist
it
also
has
a
small
dose
of
love
between
the
2
main
charact
that
throughout
the
whole
book
you
can
see
the
obvious
chemistri
that
exist
between
them
so
for
all
those
reader
who
like
the
unexpect
this
is
your
book
when
you
re
sure
that
that
s
the
guy
or
that
they
have
solv
the
mysteri
i
assur
you
you
will
be
wrong
the
truth
will
blow
your
mind
one
of
the
thing
that
i
most
enjoy
was
the
fact
that
sever
thing
were
happen
at
the
same
time
with
differ
charact
the
author
give
you
just
the
amount
of
inform
about
what
s
happen
with
one
charact
to
leav
you
hook
and
then
will
go
and
tell
you
in
the
next
chapter
what
s
happen
with
the
other
charact
and
also
leav
you
hook
so
you
won
t
be
abl
to
stop
read
you
will
read
faster
and
faster
hold
your
breath
to
the
sudden
twist
the
book
take
and
be
breathless
by
the
end
of
it
although
dan
brown
s
literatur
as
a
whole
may
not
be
veri
good
it
is
apt
for
mani
age
and
great
to
be
read
as
a
fiction
fun
book
that
will
leav
you
with
a
sweet
tast
of
mouth
when
finish
the
da
vinci
code
you
will
want
to
read
more
of
dan
brown
the
da
vinci
code
is
an
amaz
book
and
i
dare
rate
it
without
a
doubt
a
5
star
book
what
s
great
about
dan
brown
is
that
he
doesn

stop
his
masterpiec
here
he
continu
his
extravag
write
in
book
like
angel
and
demon
digit
fortress

dan
brown
has
written
a
489
page
book
over
the
cours

the
da
vinci
code
this
book
was
recommend
to
me
and
i
thought
that
dan
brown
creat
a
genius
stori
the
da
vinci
code
had
a
veri
good
flow
in
literatur
and
had
mani
twist
that
were
unpredict
one
of
the
twist
that
i
love
was
when
remi
was
realli
work
with
aringarosa
brown
show
interest
detail
and
the
main
topic
was
veri
addict
and
i
found
it
hard
to
put
the
book
down
at
first
i
thought
this
novel
was
bore
but
then
the
conflict
came
up
and
i
was
caught
up
in
the
action
brown
has
a
way
to
describ
thing
veri
effici
he
chang
the
point
of
view
to
show
how
each
charact
feel
about
what
is
go
on
there
was
a
point
in
the
stori
when
i
thought
that
it
had
been
conclud
but
action
start
to
pour
out
and
i
soon
realiz
i
was
wrong
what
realli
caught
my
attent
in
this
book
was
that
it
never
seem
to
drag
on
with
onli
one
topic
event
kept
happen
right
after
each
other
and
that
seem
to
make
the
da
vinci
code
so
amaz
brown
probabl
shouldn
t
recommend
this
stori
to
religi
christian
becaus
it
realli
was
against
it
almost
too
much
i
wouldn
t
recommend
it
to
younger
kid
becaus
of
the
matur
level
i
howev
still
found
it
veri
captiv
and
i
felt
lost
in
the
word
in
the
da

code
overal
i
could
honest
say
this
has
been
one
of
my
favorit
book
of

the

code
by

brown
the
da
vinci
code
is
a
grip
adventur
stori
i
especi
enjoy
how
dan
brown
start
the
book
i
was
recommend
to
read
this
book
by
a
friend
of
mine
brown
goe
veri
in
depth
and
doesn
t
miss
a
singl
detail
quit
frank
i
wish
he
had
written
more
i
also
must
say
this
if
you
read
this
book
you
must
read
the
prologu
it
set
up
the
entir
stori
when
i
first
heard
of
this
stori
i
was
skeptic
about
read
it
then
one
of
my
friend
recommend
it
to
me
and
i
decid
to
read
it
i
am
now
glad
that
i
did
it
made
me
feel
smart
and
even
want
to
studi
some
of
da
vinci
s
artwork
a
littl
harder
each
time
i
see
it
he
did
drag
on
in
some
part
so
it
s
not
one
of
those
book
where
there
s
a
shoot
or
fight
everi
other
page
but
there
s
still
plenti
of
action
i
veri
high
recommend
read

lukewarm
about
da
vinci
is
it
possibl
to
give
this
book
a
middl
rate
rather
than
go
to
one
extrem
or
anoth
sure
here
s
whi
for
starter
the
book
is
in
fact
a
page
turner
onc
i
start
read
it
i
didn
t
want
to
stop
whi
becaus
everi
chapter
leav
you
hang
on
the
edg
wait
for
the
next
step
in
the
adventur
while
that
is
effect
at
keep
a
reader
involv
it
also
left
me
feel
like
i
was
be
strung
along
and
that
the
pay
off
couldn
t
measur
up
to
the
expect
i
was
right
it
didn
t
the
da
vinci
code
is
altogeth
entertain
and
subsequ
altogeth
forgett
it
s
actual
been
over
a
year
sinc
i
read
the
book
and
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
the
movi
refresh
my
memori
a
bit
i
would
have
forgotten
most
of
the
major
plot
point
by
now
the
onli
part
that
stuck
with
me
were
dan
brown
s
antagonist
flog
of
christian
doctrin
without
ani
real
basi
for
the
wild
claim
he
was
make
and
the
imag
of
an
ascet
albino
murder
monk
sila
was
much
more
memor
than
ani
of
the
protagonist
oh
i
also
enjoy
the
descript
of
rosslyn
chapel
although
that
is
most
becaus
i
am
interest
in
anyth
deal
with
scottish
histori
that
s
about
it
the
charact
are
most
forgett
becaus
brown
move
so
quick
through
the
stori
that
there
is
no
time
for
develop
if
you
must
read
someth
by
dan
brown
angel
and
demon
is
better
better
plot
progress
more
vivid
locat
more
excit
climax
more
bewild
plot
twist
and
a
littl
less
sacrilegi
although
even
more
abras
toward
catholic
particular
the
vatican
charact
remain
on
the
shallow
side
if
you
choos
to
buy
either
of
brown
s
langdon
seri
book
get
the
illustr
edit
i
might
not
have
even
bother
to
read
them
without
the
pictur
they
add
to
the
stori
immens
have
said
all
that
i
will
probabl
read
brown
s
next
langdon
novel
i
am
curious
what
he
is
go
to
do
with
freemasonri
perhap
he
will
also
take
time
to
give
robert
langdon
some
backstori
and
provid
him
with
a
few
friend
human
link
that
extend
beyond
the
scope
of
the
manic
plot
and
his
arcan
life
