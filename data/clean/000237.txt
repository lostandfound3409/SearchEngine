spider

will
join
the
marvel
cinemat

in
an
announc
that
has
brought
smile
to
the
face
of
comic
geek
everywher
soni
and
marvel
joint
reveal
via
a
press
releas
that
ol’
web
head
will
take
his
place
alongsid
iron
man
the
hulk
and
the
rest
of
the
aveng
on
the
big
screen
and
soon
—
most
like
in
the
upcom
“captain
america
civil
war
”the
deal
was
announc
monday
night
after
month
of
specul
about
spidey’
possibl
movi
futur
in
the
wake
of
the
less
than
stellar
box
offic
for
“the
amaz

2
”accord
to
the
press
releas
“the

will
first

the
next
instal

on

”this
develop
is
a
huge
win
for
both
marvel
and
soni
—
not
to
mention
the
fan
clamor
for
a
more
integr
superhero
univers
—
but
there’
potenti
for
some
confus
about
what
this
actual
mean
go
forward
so
let’
break
it
down
out
with
the
old
spider
man
in
with
the
newon
question
that’
pop
up
is
whether
or
not
“the
amaz
spider
man”’
andrew
garfield
will
repris
his
role
as
peter
parker
although
not
direct
address
by
the
press
releas
it
make
numer
refer
to
a
“new
spider
man
”accord
to
an
unnam
sourc
for
the
daili
beast
the
actor
met
to
discuss
the
possibl
of
return
befor
all
agre
that
it
would
not
make
sens
news
outlet
rang
from
the
wall
street
journal
to
the
wrap
have
back
that
up
say
garfield
is
out
and
marvel
is
now
on
the
hunt
for
a
younger
actor
to
play
a
high
school
age
spider
man
with
varieti
name
“perci
jackson”
star
logan
lerman
and
“the
maze
runner”’
dylan
o’brien
as
two
candid
alreadi
be
eye
by
marvel
and
soni
although
no
actor
have
been
approach
other
name
that
have
been
toss
around
accord
to
dark
horizon
includ
taron
egerton
“kingsman
the

asa
butterfield
“ender’

donald

“community”
zac

and
current

actor
nomine
eddi
redmayn
“the
theori
of
everything”
no
offici
announc
have
been
made
though
in
fact
it’
not
even
clear
yet
if
this
spider
man
will
still
be
peter
parker
and
not
say
the
ultim
line
of
comics’
spider
man
mile
moral
so
take
that
all
with
a
grain
of
salt
marvel
still
doe
not
own
the
film
rightsamidst
all
the
hoopla
surround
the
news
of
spider
man
appear
in
the
mcu
there
has
been
a
lot
of
talk
of
him
return
to
marvel
not
that
this
should
necessarili
temper
the
excit
but
to
be
clear
spider
man’
film
right
—
and
therefor
creativ
control
—
still
belong
to
soni
as
is
made
explicit
in
the
press
releas
“soni
pictur
will
continu
to
financ
distribut
own
and
have
final
creativ
control
of
the
spider
man
film
”in
fact
accord
to
the
hollywood
report
this
deal
did
not
even
involv
ani
money
chang
hand
between
the
two
rival
studio
it
was
broker
on
an
entir
quid
pro
quo
basi
take
a
pessimist
view
of
thing
this
could
ultim
turn
out
not
to
be
as
big
an
improv
as
fan
might
hope
sinc
this
is
still
the
same
soni
that
push
sam
raimi
to
includ
venom
in
“spider
man
3”
and
reboot
the
franchis
a
mere
five
year
later
and
whose
interfer
accord
to
garfield
may
have
sabotag
“the
amaz
spider
man
2
”the
key
differ
will
be
in
the
produc
the
new
spider
man
film
say
the
press
releas
“will
be
co
produc
by
kevin
feig
and
his
expert
team
at
marvel
and
ami
pascal
who
oversaw
the
franchis
launch
for
the
studio
13
year
ago
togeth
they
will
collabor
on
a
new
creativ
direct
for
the
web
slinger
”
“the
amaz
spider
man”’
product
team
of
matt
tolmach
and
avi
arad
meanwhil
will
be
demot
to
execut
produc
status
mean
they
will
have
no
creativ
input
of
possibl
concern
to
fan
are
more
recent
report
from
site
like
comicbook
com
say
that
sony’
other
spider
man
relat
project
like
“the
sinist
six
”
“venom”
and
an
as
yet
unnam
femal
led
superhero
movi
possibl
“black
cat”
or
“spider
woman”
are
all
still
in
develop
but
that
feig
will
not
be
creativ
involv
with
ani
of
them
finger
cross
this
doe
not
includ
the
rumor
aunt
may
prequel
film
that
suppos
retool
the
charact
as
a
swing
1960s
spi
i
kid
you
not
presum
whatev
spider
man
spinoff
are
produc
will
be
brought
into
line
with
the
new
direct
and
the
larger
mcu
but
for
mani
fan
feige’
involv
would
do
a
lot
to
guarante
a
certain
level
of
qualiti
this
could
be
just
the
begin
of
the
studios’
collaborationin
addit
to
spider
man
appear
in
marvel
film
negoti
are
also
report
under
way
to
possibl
have
marvel
charact
appear
in
futur
soni
spider
man
movi
this
open
up
interest
possibl
to
see
some
classic
marvel
team
up
on
the
big
screen
such
as
for
instanc
spidey
and
his
hell’
kitchen
neighbor
daredevil
who
is
also
in
the
process
of
be
reboot
by
marvel
with
a
netflix
seri
premier
april
10
the
two
charact
share
mani
of
the
same
villain
includ
daredevil’
main
baddi
kingpin
so
it
would
make
a
lot
of
sens
for
them
to
join
forc
addit
it
would
be
a
smart
way
for
marvel
to
bring
charli
cox’
daredevil
to
the
big
screen
without
have
to
do
a
standalon
daredevil
movi
as
one
of
marvel’
most
belov
charact
spider
man
has
cross
path
with
pretti
much
everyon
though
so
the
possibl
are
endless
so
what
about
the
other
non
mcu
marvel
properti
now
that
spider
man
has
return
to
the
fold
sort
of
fan
are
alreadi
wonder
how
long
befor
marvel
strike
a
similar
deal
with
fox
to
have
the
x
men
and
fantast
four
join
the
mcu
the
simpl
answer
is
probabl
“don’t
hold
your
breath
”wherea
“the
amaz
spider
man
2”’s
box
offic
number
left
soni
doubt
the
direct
it
had
taken
with
the
wall
crawler
—
it
was
the
lowest
gross
of
all
five
spider
man
movi
—
fox
is
current
ride
high
on
the
success
of
“x
men
day
of
futur
past
”
with
“fantast
four”
come
out
later
this
year
and
the
ryan
reynold
led
“deadpool”
and
chan
tatum
led
“gambit”
in
the
pipelin
fox
alreadi
has
it
share
univers
to
play
in
after
hear
the
news
of
the
soni
marvel
deal
hugh
jackman
who
has
talk
open
in
the
past
about
want
to
see
more
collabor
between
the
studio
so
wolverin
could
someday
tussl
onscreen
with
