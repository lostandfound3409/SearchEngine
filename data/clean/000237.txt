and
ani
previous
soni
plan
have
been
cancel
we
will
see
spider

in
captain
america
civil
war
it
was
announc
soon
after
pascal’
departur
i
believ
she’
even
still
involv
in
some
capac
so
the
deal
was
probabl
near
complet
befor
she
left
releas
an

inform
show
that
this

has
no

what’
realli
go

after
the

peopl
thought
that
those
plan
might
be
up
in
the
air
sinc
we
then
knew
that
marvel
could
possibl
be
involv
right
after
pascal
depart
possibl
even
onli
a
day
or
two
after
in
not
sure
of
the
exact
time
they
announc
the
