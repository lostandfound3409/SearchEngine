recal
the

rumbl
of
the

he
rememb
the
excit
he
felt
about
return
to
headley
grang
the
18th
centuri
english
estat
where
the
group
had
record
it
landmark
fourth
lp
i
knew
what
we
could
do
at
headley
grang
after
have
had
such
a
reward
and
product
experi
there
befor
he
say
i
knew
the
secret
of
what
could
be
done
there
what
was
it
about
return
to
headley
grang
that
excit
you
i
knew
how
we
did
the
drum
in
the
main
hall
for
the
fourth
album
s
when
the
leve
break
and
some
number
would
come
out
of
thin
air
like
for
exampl
the
way
rock
roll
did
on
the
fourth
album
and
then
on
physic
graffiti
trampl
under
foot
which
came
out
of
thin
air
like
that
just
start
out
of
a
riff
i
was
basic
music
saliv
on
the
way
there
i
was
just
look
forward
to
the
whole
process
of
everybodi
be
there
and
just
have
a
whole
run
at
basic
work
out
whatev
materi
i
had
had
or
anyon
els
might
ve
had
you
had
written
music
at
home
prior
to
the
session
were
you
live
in
aleist
crowley
s
former
estat
at
that
point
no
i
wasn
t
at
crowley
s
hous
i
live
in
the
countrysid
in
sussex
and
it
was
a
realli
interest
hous
at
the
top
of
the
hous
i
had
a
multitrack
studio
put
in
and
it
gave
me
a
chanc
to
work
on
textur
i
had
the
whole
of
ten
year
gone
all
of
the
guitar
orchestr
prepar
in
that
hous
i
came
up
with
the
wanton
song
and
sick
again
and
i
had
the
whole
concept
of
the
kashmir
basic
there
how
did
the
session
at
headley
grang
begin
it
sort
of
kick
off
with
myself
and
john
bonham
there
i
had
a
good
half
dozen
thing
at
least
and
one
of
them
—
the
first
one
that
i
couldn
t
wait
to
get
the
drum
in
the
hall
to
get
this
big
drum
sound
and
then
play
the
riff
of
—
was
kashmir
i
want
to
tri
out
these
idea
that
i
had
for
the
cascad
brass
part
and
figur
out
the
guitar
s
pace
on
it
i
alway
thought
of
that
guitar
part
as
be
someth
that
was
augment
by
the
orchestra
basic
it
was
just
realli
good
to
start
kick
it
off
with
him
caus
he
and
i
work
so
well
togeth
this
was
meant
to
be
someth
pretti
epic
and
substanti
what
were
the
root
of
kashmir
well
i
had
the
idea
for
the
riff
and
the
cascad
part
which
is
actual
electr
12
string
and
it
s
brass
on
the
record
from
someth
that
i
had
been
work
on
befor
we
even
went
to
headley
it
was
anoth
piec
of
music
entir
and
right
at
the
veri
end
of
it
while
i
was
play
along
i
play
the
acoust
guitar
part
in
revers
and
there
was
a
sort
of
fanfar
or
the
cascad
follow
by
the
riff
and
i
thought
whoa
it
just
occur
right
at
the
end
i
said
oh
boy
i
can
visual
this
it
s
go
to
be
built
around
the
drum
kit
and
i
m
go
to
get
in
there
with
john
bonham
it
s
the
first
thing
that
i
ran
through
with
him
becaus
i
just
know
that
he
is
gon
na
love
it
and
he
love
it
and
we
just
play
the
riff
over
and
over
and
over
becaus
it
s
like
a
child
s
riff
music
it
s
a
round
like
frère
jacqu
where
you
can
lay
thing
on
top
of
it
that
was
the
idea
of
have
this
riff
that
was
gon
na
be
realli
intens
and
probabl
pretti
majest
as
well
but
quit
intrigu
but
the
fact
was
it
was
go
to
be
built
around
the
sound
of
headley
and
the
drum
in
the
hall
that
s
how
i
heard
it
and
that
s
how
i
saw
it
but
i
also
heard
it
with
orchestra
in
mind
it
was
the
first
track
where
we
actual
heard
the
complement
of
a
full
orchestra
on
top
of
the
brass
and
the
string
we
d
use
string
on
friend
on
the
third
album
just
a
small
string
session
but
this
was
realli
someth
that
was
meant
to
be
pretti
epic
and
substanti
robert
plant
has
attribut
the
lyric
to
kashmir
to
a
trip
you
two
took
in
morocco
was
the
riff
similar
inspir
no
it
had
alreadi
been
take
on
a
realli
magnific
and
substanti
shape
and
robert
said
you
know
i
ve
got
some
lyric
that
i
wrote
when
we
were
in
morocco
i
d
like
to
tri
on
this
and
that
s
what
he
did
but
that
was
way
after
the
event
of
actual
have
the
whole
of
the
structur
of
the
song

getti
you
includ
a
rough
orchestra
mix
of
the
song
on
the
new
companion
disc
what
stand
out
to
you
about
it
the
phase
of
the
drum
isn
t
appar
on
this
one
it
s
a
differ
mix
all
togeth
but
the
placement
of
it
is
realli
good
as
far
as
the
posit
on
the
mix
there
s
a
sort
of
3
d
perspect
like
the
old
3
d
film
where
you
could
actual
touch
thing
when
they
were
come
past
you
it
s
more
like
that
in
a
sonic
pictur
everyth
includ
the
background
is
in
focus
the
most
surpris
track
on
the
companion
disc
is
everybodi
make
it
through
which
becam
in
the
light
how
did
that
transform
take
place
that
version
is
a
combin
of
riff
idea
and
the
structur
is
made
up
of
it
at
that
point
in
time
on
everybodi
make
it
through
robert
is
sing
a
guid
vocal
as
a
point
of
refer
it
also
doesn
t
have
the
intro
drone
it
was
alway
gon
na
have
a
drone
to
it
which
is
a
bow
guitar
and
you
hear
those
sort
of
bow
switch
on
and
switch
in
on
the
final
version
but
john
paul
jone
come
in
and
land
this
absolut
miracul
synthes
part
that
open
up
in
the
light
it
s
just
phenomen
and
then
robert
come
in
and
doe
those
block
vocal
which
to
me
alway
sound
like
some
choral
music
that
i
had
heard
from
the
music
of
bulgaria
so
you
can
hear
the
work
that
was
individu
put
into
those
thing
i
must
say
that
as
far
as
all
of
these
extra
thing
the
studio
album
version
are
better
but
all
these
other
version
are
realli
of
great
signific
interest
i
believ
relat
jimmi
page
led
zeppelin
was
an
affair
of
the
heart
it
seem
like
that
one
develop
more
than
some
of
the
other
song
on
the
album
it
just
depend
on
whether
you
caught
it
with
the
first
take
like
custard
pie
or
trampl
under
foot
even
trampl
under
foot
is
brandi
and
coke
on
the
companion
disc
and
that
s
realli
interest
for
it
energi
but
you
can
also
see
all
the
extra
sort
of
work
that
goe
into
it
as
far
as
the
overdub
same
deal
with
in
my
time
of
die
that
one
is
like
the
full
11
minut
there
were
no
edit
or
drop
in
or
overdub
to
the
version
you
hear
this
is
led
zeppelin
just
go
for
it
for
an
11
minut
song
with
all
the
chang
in
it
and
everyth
and
the
music
map
that
you
have
to
rememb
when
it
goe
1
2
3
4
tape
roll
whi
were
you
interest
in
drone
at
the
time
anyway
well
the
drone
we
use
at
the
open
of
the
concert
that
actual
came
out
as
how
the
west
was
won
the
one
in
long
beach
and
l
a
forum
and
it
was
just
an
acoust
guitar
that
was
track
i
use
the
bow
go
way
back
into
the
day
of
the
yardbird
and
a
littl
bit
befor
that
but
it
was
someth
i
took
veri
serious
but
that
was
on
electr
guitar
i
want
to
get
the
densiti
if
you
like
of
an
acoust
guitar
tune
into
a
chord
and
just
sort
of
bow
and
just
build
it
up
like
you
d
have
over
an
orchestr
thing
almost
or
modern
classic
compos
krzysztof
penderecki
he
would
have
like
that
laugh
the
idea
of
use
the
drone
even
preced
that
album
but
it
realli
come
into
effect
there
that
s
for
sure
it
was
the
earli
day
of
ambient
music
if
you
like
it
s
just
total
attitud
which
is
probabl
in
my
dna
i
ve
read
that
john
paul
jone
said
you
never
play
in
the
light
live
becaus
it
would
be
too
hard
to
replic
we
could
have
done
it
at
that
point
in
time
i
think
he
s
still
in
the
posit
that
the
synthes
were
monophon
mayb
but
further
on
down
the
road
mayb
on
the
77
tour
we
could
have
done
it
mayb
we
should
have
play
it
at
the
o2
becaus
i
know
that
the
keyboard
of
today
are
more
complet
but
the
song
didn
t
come
into
the
equat
we
never
even
took
it
on
go
back
to
the
final
album
anoth
song
you
had
held
onto
from
previous
session
was
the
rover
did
that
take
a
lot
to
develop
it
was
someth
that
was
start
when
we
were
at
stargrov
estat
for
hous
of
the
holi
but
it
got
work
on
when
we
actual
got
to
headley
on
the
second
visit
where
we
did
guitar
overdub
and
it
was
mix
at
olymp
the
whole
thing
about
the
rover
is
the
whole
swagger
of
it
the
whole
guitar
attitud
swagger
i
m
afraid
i
ve
got
to
say
it
but
it
s
the
sort
of
thing
that
is
so
appar
when
you
hear
rumbl
by
link
wray
—
it
s
just
total
attitud
isn
t
it
so
that
sort
of
thing
which
is
sort
of
probabl
in
my
dna
to
be
honest
with
you
whi
was
physic
graffiti
ultim
a
doubl
album
it
gave
us
the
chanc
to
put
in
the
materi
that
was
left
over
from
the
first
visit
to
headley
there
were
three
track
that
were
left
off
of
the
fourth
album
and
that
was
boogi
with
stu
night
flight
and
down
by
the
seasid
if
you
think
about
it
you
couldn
t
have
substitut
anyth
off
the
fourth
album
with
ani
of
those
track
quit
right
so
each
of
them
had
their
own
individu
charm
and
charact
so
with
those
plus
the
fact
that
hous
of
the
holi
was
a
track
that
wasn
t
includ
on
the
album
hous
of
the
holi
that
was
four
thing
straight
away
to
includ
and
you
know
given
the
chanc
of
have
a
good
run
at
this
write
and
record
process
i
didn
t
want
it
to
be
a
doubl
album
with
ani
pad
on
it
it
would
be
a
doubl
album
with
all
charact
piec
the
way
that
led
zeppelin
did
their
music
with
the
sort
of
etho
of
it
if
you
like
that
everyth
sound
differ
to
everyth
els
you
also
had
your
label
to
think
about
at
the
time
it
was
the
first
led
zeppelin
album
that
was
go
to
be
on
the
swan
song
record
label
that
peter
grant
had
help
put
togeth
for
the
band
with
atlant
have
a
record
label
was
a
realli
cool
idea
becaus
it
gave
us
a
chanc
to
showcas
peopl
that
we
realli
like
and
respect
so
as
an
exampl
paul
rodger
band
bad
compani
which
was
one
of
the
first
releas
and
also
the
pretti
thing
we
all
did
high
of
and
i
thought
what
they
did
on
swan
song
was
good

you
were
work
on
the
soundtrack
for
kenneth
anger
s
film
lucif
rise
which
you
re
reissu
soon
around
that
time
you
made
physic
graffiti
too
yeah
have
the
facil
to
have
this
multitrack
at
home
i
could
tri
experi
with
sort
of
all
of
the
instrument
give
them
differ
treatment
so
they
didn
t
actual
sound
necessarili
like
the
instrument
itself
so
the
tabla
drum
they
don
t
sound
like
tabla
drum
and
there
s
a
big
tambura
that
sound
pretti
radic
differ
the
version
that
s
come
out
has
got
the
guitar
guid
to
it
so
there
was
an
acoust
guitar
to
it
that
i
took
out
in
mani
other
version
but
it
s
pretti
interest
was
there
ani
crossov
between
what
you
did
with
lucif
rise
and
physic
graffiti
i
knew
that
that
sort
of
stuff
wasn
t
necessarili
the
way
that
led
zeppelin
was
go
to
go
although
it
s
still
there
in
all
it
was
like
my
own
sketchpad
and
i
tri
thing
out
that
are
pretti
radic
i
was
push
myself
that
s
what
it
was
in
everi
degre
in
everi
angl
you
came
up
with
the
titl
physic
graffiti
what
was
the
concept
behind
it
graffiti
had
start
to
appear
on
build
at
the
time
and
usual
it
was
quot
from
william
blake
and
it
wasn
t
in
the
graffiti
which
we
know
think
of
which
was
more
from
the
hip
hop
time
nevertheless
graffiti
was
appear
and
i
imagin
someth
which
was
like
a
physic
reaction
to
it
sinc
we
were
in
a
record
studio
if
you
re
do
a
record
and
it
s
go
on
the
tape
even
though
it
magnet
tape
that
s
like
a
graffiti
in
itself
the
music
was
a
physic
manifest
last
you
ve
said
you
re
now
work
on
a
new
guitar
project
and
also
that
it
began
with
play
acoust
guitar
what
will
it
be
i
intend
to
be
do
someth
which
obvious
will
surfac
as
a
sort
of

somewher
it
ll
surfac
further
on
down

line
i
m
look
forward
to
do
whatev
the
project
is

if
you

about
all
the

whether
