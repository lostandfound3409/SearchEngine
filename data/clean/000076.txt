due
to
the
subject

the

this
is
a
magnific
book
in
mani
way
most
of
which
have
been
comment
on
often
brilliant
by
amazon
review
i
would
therefor
like
to
restrict
my
comment
to
the
moral
of
the
book
and
to
those
who
to
this
day
view
the
book
with
outrag
even
those
who
admir
the
book
somehow
feel
compel
to
comment
that
they
are
disturb
by
it
whi
is
this
let
us
first
examin
the
novel
itself
as
everybodi
know
it
is
the
stori
of
humbert
humbert
a
full
grown
adult
male
not
an
old
man
who
seduc
a
compliant
twelv
year
old
girl
and
then
goe
on
to
have
a
year
or
so
long
affair
with
her
i
put
the
term
affair
in
quotat
mark
becaus
it
probabl
isn
t
appropri
to
describ
a
sexual
relationship
between
a
full
grown
male
and
a
femal
child
in
such
term
is
it
safe
to
say
that
most
ration
human
be
disapprov
of
such
relationship
it
is
certain
safe
to
say
that
nabakov
and
his
narrat
know
that
such
relationship
are
wrong
this
is
import
the
tale
is
not
onli
told
in
the
context
of
a
moral
univers
it
is
also
told
by
a
charact
who
is
in
accept
of
a
moral
univers
oh
he
make
a
comment
here
and
there
about
some
mediev
king
marri
his
twelv
year
old
cousin
but
clear
his
heart
isn
t
in
it
he
know
that
he
is
a
monster
a
brute
inde
his
goal
was
never
to
have
sex
with
a
conscious
lolita
to
begin
with
his
goal
initi
was
onli
to
fondl
her
after
drug
her
to
induc
sleep
she
was
never
to
know
what
he
was
do
of
cours
this
is
also
reprehens
but
clear
it
show
a
conscienc
at
work
a
conscienc
motiv
in
part
by
fear
to
be
sure
but
also
a
conscienc
for
the
welfar
at
least
earli
on
of
this
littl
girl
conscienc
is
not
