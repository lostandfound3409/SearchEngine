that
is
a

thing
poor
written
or
not
if
you
finish
the
book
you
will
notic
that
dan
brown
even
make
it
clear
to
reader
through
his
charact
word
that
he
doesn
t
want
to
destroy
christian
becaus
it
has
done
so
much
good
for
so
mani
peopl
and
if
it
work
for
them
let
s
let
them
continu
to
do
what
work
for
them
but
find
your
own
path
if
you
were
or
are
a
christian
ask
yourself
about
the
topic
in
this
book
they
are
so
eye
open
jesus
have
a
babi
total
possibl
never
thought
of
it
befor
never
thought
of
it
is
it
true
who
know
thing
like
this
are
happen
all
the
time
today
weapon
of
mass
destruct
in
iraq
sound
familiar
mayb
the
church
repress
inform
like
this
becaus
it
was
a
threat
to
the
church
total
possibl
the
cathol
church
creat
the
biblic
canon
with
a
polit
agenda
to
wipe
out
pagan
actual
this
seem
to
be
a
fact
women
be
oppress
due
to
the
fear
of
relig
zealot
men
in
power
lose
their
power
never
look
at
it
that
way
but
this
seem
to
be
a
fact
too
is
it
help
in
broaden
my
perspect
of
the
fact
that
christian
is
just
a
religion
made
by
fallibl
peopl
it
sure
is
doe
it
open
my
mind
to
other
faith
like
pagan
judiasm
islam
bhuddism
and
want
to
take
the
truth
from
all
of
them
and
then
think
for
myself
and
figur
out
my
own
truth
it
sure
doe
and
that
is
what
this
book
has
probabl
done
for

do
you

so
that

simultan
claim
that
it

just

while
introduc

with
claim
that
the

fact
that
claim
is
ridicul
to
pluck
a
random
exampl
he
spend
some

talk
about
the

incorrect

even
by
the

that
he
is
sympathet
to
that
the
earliest
gnostic
doctrin
held
that
christ
was
pure
god
and
not
realli
man
the
veri
revers
of
the
doctrin
that
serv
as
the
linchpin
of
his
novel
s
intellectu
base
such
as
it
is
this
is
a
bad
novel
for
weak

misinform
christian
but
anyon

someth
i

realli
enjoy
the

just
run

and
leav
it
at
that
turn
on

kill
amount
of
plod
for

turn
actioni

there
was
just

much
sideway
movement
of
the

and
some
realli
unnecessari
amount
of
plod
to
the
narrat
part
of

has
to
do
with
the
excess
â€œhand

with

there
are
also
way
too
much
time
spent
slow
down
to
take
a
look
around
and
where
we
are
and
where
weâ€™v
been
i
start
get
the
impress
that
brown
was
tri
to
hit
a
particular
page
count
for
the
book
and
didnâ€™t
have
anyth
but
filler
to
loan
the
page
with
this
is
never
a
good
thing
for
this
kind
of
stori
3
the
end
not
a
big
fan
of
the
final
resolut
of
the
stori
and
i
found
it
veri
un

a

down
onc
we
have
the

a

was
in

home
stretch
this
lack

climax
left
me
with

serious
case
of
â€œblue

still
overal
this
was
a
good

seem

on

sand
it
isnâ€™t
great

even
good
literatur

it
is
a
good

a
good

for
the

the

you

well
i
ve

done
more
legitim

he

almost
seem

the

brown
know

some
of
the

the

cryptologist
sophi

who
is
tout
as
brilliant
but
who
spend

of

they
run
around

in
about
a
48
hour

be
chase
by

baddi
this

has
been
set

somehow
manag
to

lead
our

to
the
big

confus
rememb
the

where
tom

spend
99
of
the
time
with
a
puzzl
frown
on
his
face
and
the
dumbest
hairstyl
i
have
ever

him
wear
imag
error
that
frown
is
reflect
on
my
face
as
i
tri
to
figur
out
how
in
the
world
this
novel
got
to
be
so
popular
i
think
the
answer
lie
in
the
fact
that
if
you
just
give
up
on
ani
attempt
to
analyz
what
db
is
posit
don
t
worri
about
the
write
and
just
go
with
the
flow
you
get
a
page
turner
that
hurtl
you
toward
the
point
where
you
are
merci
done
with
the
book
that
s
what
that
second
star
is
for
and
there
are
ton
of
peopl
who
love
all
that
esoter
mysteri
stuff
plus
the
book
came
to
the
attent
of
a
certain
type
of
christian
who
is
veri
easi
to
bait
into
perceiv
ani
critic
of
ani
aspect
of
christian
as
a
huge
threat
and
the
result
kerfuffl
must
have
had
db
s
publicist
offer
up
heartfelt
prayer
of
thanksgiv
nope
i
m
still
puzzl
on
my
second
time
around
i
realli
paid
attent
to
the
write
and
came
to
the
conclus
that
the
da
vinci
code
is
a
truli
execr
piec
of
prose
that
manag
to
includ
just
about
everi
mistak
wannab
novelist
are
told
to
avoid
i
particular
love
the
way
you
re
in
the
middl
of
an
excit
chase
around
and
then
the
action
sudden
grind
to
a
halt
while
langdon
launch
into
yet
anoth
of
his
explan
and
the
bit
where
db
was
obvious
write
with
a
map
of
pari
and
a
guidebook
at
his
elbow
so
that
you
get
turn
by
turn
street
nav
and
a
guid
tour
of
wherev
they
happen
to
be
down
to
the
exact
dimens
of
the
room
and
can
you
say
plot
illog
and
what
about
the
move
bodi
part
langdon
s
eye
follow
her
arm
to
the
structur
ahead
and
db
s
cringeworthili
bad
understand
of
british
well
everyth
as
personifi
in
sir
lee
tebe
twas
an
audiobook
so
the
spell
may
be
wrong
i
person
like
sur
t
bing
the
other
charact
even
those
who
should
have
known
kept
call
him
sir
tebe
it
should
be
sir
lee
and
even
at
one
glorious
moment
your
knightship
and
he
put
clot
cream
in
his
tea
pleas
see
this
discuss
so
i
don
t
have
to
go
over
it
again
last
but
definit
not
least
there
was
suppos
to
be
some
sexual
attract
between
langdon
and
neveu
but
ani
time
db
went
there
it
was
as
awkward
as
watch
your
brother
come
on
to
your
bff
there
s
someth
eerili
virgin
about
langdon
which
i
swear
manag
to
communic
itself
to
hank
never
have
i
seen
the
tom
look
less
attract
this
is
definit
not
the
best
book
to
listen
to
as
an
audiobook
unless
you
are
veri
veri
masochist
the
narrat
has
to
do
huge
chunk
of
the
stori
in
a
french
accent
and
then
there
s
lee
tebe
who
got
a
ludicr
overblown
stage
british
heehaw
voic
in
my
version
then
there
was
the
pronunci
of
louvr
as
loov
and
tuileri
as
tooleri
but
you
know
i
ve
got
to
hand
it
to

scab
on
the

book
with

patterson
remark
with
evid
contempt
that
there
were
no

in

rememb
correct
shakespear

well
i
m
a
big
fan
of

process
i
thought
saddam
hussein
was
a
monster
who
deserv
death
fifti
time
over
but
i
oppos
the
iraq
war
on
the
ground
that
virtual
the
onli
bad
thing
he
hadn
t
done
was
to
harbor
secret
weapon
of
mass
destruct
which
was
the
ostens
reason
for
invad
his
countri
my
feel
about
dan
brown
were
similar
so
the
letter
point
out
that
ms
patterson
was
just
cherri
pick
her
author
as
far
as
i
was
awar
she
was
quit
correct
in
say
that
shakespear
dicken
and
tolstoy
didn
t
do
puzzl
and
treasur
hunt
but
if
she
d
want
to
argu
the
contrari
posit
she
could
just
as
easili
have
cite
lewi
carrol
jame
joyc
and
vladimir
nabokov
the
real
problem
with
dan
brown
was
not
the
subject
matter
but
the
qualiti
of
the
write
sigh
i
thought
i
d
better
come
clean
i
d
rather
that
you
hear
it
from
me
direct
than
you
know
just
stumbl
over
it
by
accid
when
you
re
follow
a
random
link
mayb
some
day
you
ll
be
abl
to
forgiv
me
and
while
we
re
talk
about
dan
brown
and
random
link
check
this

in

to
the
power
of
the
feminin
wile
sv
convinc
me
to
read
it
and
so
at
the
suggest
of
professor
morti
borrow
a
copi
from
my
local
librari
befor
set
out
for
the
thanksgiv
holiday
thank
to
pg
and
laurion
for
their
lend
offer
though
i
did
not
take
them
up
on
it
so
what
did
i
think
of
this
incred
popular
high
controversi
work
that
sold
liter
million
of
copi
spawn
a
movi
and
produc
comment
from
the
vatican
itself
in
a
word
itâ€™
bad
other
appropri
singl
word
might
be
aw
atroci
terribl
or
abomin
other
similar
synonym
can
be
found
here
the
da
vinci
code
is
a
combin
of
bad
write
shoddi
histori
poor
plot
and
unconvinc
charact
that
blend
togeth
to
form
a
bare
readabl
work
the
fact
that
anyon
took
this
work
serious
in
ani
capac
is
amaz
to
me
the
charact
are
flat
bore
and
none
of
them
exceed
two
dimens
at
best
the
is
so
riddl
with
hole
as
to
be
complet
unbeliev
to
the
semi
alert
observ
my
favorit
part
is
the
explan
of
how
the
churchâ€™
desir
to
destroy
the
â€œsacr
is
respons
for
orthodox
jew
and
devout
muslim
bar
women
from
certain
rite
and
final
the
plot
just
make
no
damn
sens
even
the
much
vaunt
puzzl
are
fair
trite
and
usual
explain
so
quick
that
itâ€™
bare
worth
think
about
the
final
puzzl
that
the
main
charact
is
face
with
is
so
mind
boggl
obvious
that
anyon
who
know
how
to
draw
a
mogen
david
star
of
david
can
figur
it
out
instant
so
the
question
for
me
becam
this
given
how
aw
this
book
is
whi
the
hell
is
it
so
popular
i
can
offer
the
follow
explan
observ
first
off
brown
employ
a
clever
and
i
use
the
term
loos
narrat
structur
in
which
he
end
everi
singl
chapter
on
a
cliffhang
this
forc
the
reader
to
continu
read
hope
to
reach
a
payoff
or
stop
point
that
is
never
quit
realiz
thus
the
reader
keep
go
to
the
next
chapter
hope
to
final
hit
a
point
where
the
stori
will
relax
onli
to
discov
that
the
stori
never
realli
relax
it
just
plod
relentless
forward
like
the
termin
chase
sarah
connor
with
a
sudoku
puzzl
in
a
similar
vein
brown
keep
his
chapter
short
in
fact
iâ€™v
read
vers
poetri
that
was
longer
than
some
of
the
chapter
in
this
book
and
consider
better
written
this
help
the
reader
feel
as
though
they
are
make
progress
becaus
theyâ€™r
sudden
on
chapter
44
and
can
reach
chapter
50
with
onli
a
few
extra
minut
of
read
hooray
for
the
short
attent
span
likewis
brown
tap
into
some
popular
polit
and
histor
fallaci
that
are
guarante
to
make
him
well
like
name
that
the
cathol
church
is
an
evil
conspiraci
christian
is
one
of
the
few
religion
itâ€™
still
ok
to
hate
in
this
day
and
age
after
all
and
the
notion
that
ancient
european
were
all
ecolog
conscious
goddess

pacifist
until

destroy

a

at

the
stori
is
fiction
after
all
and
one
should
expect
to
have
his
her
credul
stretch
especi
when
read
pulp
that
is
written
with
the
screen
in
mind
as
the
da
vinci
code
sure
was
i
even
enjoy
the
sunday
afternoon
it
took
me
to
read
the
da
vinci
code
it
was
an
absolut
wast
of
time
and
exact
what
i
want
to
be
do
sit
on
a
comfi
sofa
drink
tea
and
read
about
self
flagel
albino
monk
and
other
fun
thing
i
ve
given
mani
book
that
are
just
as
good
as
the
da
vinci
code
and
even
some
that
are
wors
three
star
and
i
meant
everi
star
the
truth
is
that
on
it
own
merit
i
d
have
given
the
da
vinci
code
a
similar
rate
if
not
for
a
repeat
experi
that
led
to
my
backlash
at
the
begin
of
everi
semest
in
a
bid
to
get
to
know
my
student
better
i
play
a
memori
game
wherein
the
student
provid
me
with
their
favourit
thing
book
food
music
and
some
person
detail
peopl
they
hate
peopl
they
love
thing
they
are
proud
of
then
i
connect
someth
about
them
someth
that
stand
out
for
me
with
their
name
it
is
a
good
start
in
get
to
know
the
student
but
it
has
also
led
to
my
hatr
for
dan
brown
s
the
da
vinci
code
a
good
half
of
the
student
that
enter
my
cours
declar
that
they
don
t
have
favourit
book
and
or
they
ve
onli
ever
read
three
book
in
their
live
two
involuntari
both
assign
by
an
english
teacher
and
alway
seem
to
includ
to
kill
a
mockingbird
and
one
voluntari
the
da
vinci
code
what
piss
me
off
most
is
that
even
if
these
peopl
like
the
da
vinci
code
brown
s
novel
didn
t
spur
them
on
to
read
more
they
read
the
the
da
vinci
code
enjoy
it
or
didn
t
then
went
back
to
their
read
apathi
moreov
if
i
could
convinc
peopl
to
read
one
book
voluntarili
one
book
for
their
pleasur
it
would
not
be
ani
cheesi
pulpi
low
grade
adventur
stori
it
s
like
pour
a
glass
of
9
dollar
wine
for
a
person
who
is
tri
wine
for
the
first
time
they
may
enjoy
the
glass
but
they
re
not
go
to
choos
wine
as
their
alcohol
of
choic
base
on
fortant
de
franc
and
for
that
reason
i
hate
the
da
vinci
code
it
is
the
cheap
wine
that
keep
peopl
away
from
the
joy
of
good
wine
and
while
i
admit
that
it
is
the
fault
of
popular
cultur
rather
than
dan
brown
each
reader
i
find
who
stop
at
the
da
vinci
code
make
me
hate
the
book
