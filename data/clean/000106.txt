format
mass
market
paperback
in
my
opinion
this
is
the
veri
best
higgin
book
it
is
the
type
of
novel
that
onc
into
it
the
reader
simpli
can
not
put
down
especi
after
the
team
land
in
england
the
premis
of
the
stori
is
a
group
of
german
that
have
a
mission
to
kidnap
churchil
the
leader
kurt
steiner
a
paratroop
is
a
veri
compel
charact
which
make
th
reader
simpath
with
him
on
the
other
side
is
liam

a
former

help
the
team
in
england
the
stori
unfold
seamless
with
the
german
team
recruit
help
in
england
of
nazi
simpath
then
move
in
and
plan
the
kidnap
at
churchil
s
countri
estat
as
they
are
almost
readi
for
the
kidnap
two
children
almost
drown
and
one
of
the
german
tri
to
help
them
blow
his
cover
then
i
should
say
no
more
as
the
stori
becom
a
thriller
that
the
reader
just
can
not
put
down
it
end
in
an
unexpect
climax
though
earli
in
higgin
career
i
think
this
remain
his
veri
best

it

not

his
