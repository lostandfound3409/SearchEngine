the
fact
behind
the
unknown
mission
after
find
the

of
13
german

curious
he

him
suspect
that
there

after
further

the

the
stori
is
higgin
recount
what
he
has
piec
togeth
through
a

guesswork
i
thought
this
was
a
veri
high
qualiti
book
i
found
it
to
be
a
veri
well
written
stori
and
i
have
zero
complaint
about
the
strength
of
higgin
prose
in
addit
i
think
higgin
did
an
extrem
good
job
of
creat
three
dimension
nuanc
charact
that
came
to
life
and
appear
complet
human
includ
the
german
soldier
but
more
on
that
in
a
minut
final
higgin
did
an
fabul
job
of
construct
a
well
thought
out
high
detail
and
credibl
plot
in

word
this
has
all
the
make
of

2
0
star
first
pleas
stop
yell
at
me
and
i
will
tell
you
see
as
good
as
i
thought
the
novel
was
on
a
technic
level
i
found
the
stori
itself
fair
dri
at
the
best
of
time
and
actual
quit
bore
at
the
worst
of
time
now
bore
or
dri
when
deal
with
non
fiction
or
even
classic
may
still
earn
3
star
or
higher
if
they
impart
deeper
mean
or
just
load
you
up
with
knowledg
howev
fiction
is
differ
i
read
that
to
enjoy
myself
and
so
dri
and
bore
becom
tough
hurdl
to
overcom
here
are
my
four
main
gripe
1
one
of
the
reason
higgin
cite
for
the
popular
of
the
book
in
his
introduct
is
that
it
was
the
first
time
that
regular
german
soldier
as
distinguish
from
those
within
the
nazi
hierarchi
were
portray
in
fiction
as
human
be
and
not
bloodthirsti
monster
while
the
portray
of
german
soldier
as
regular
peopl
is
certain
laudabl
i
must
disagre
that
higgin
was
a
trailblaz
in
this
area
long
befor
this
book
was
evedwritten
the
world
had
been
introduc
to
the
follow
two
loveabl
scamp
and
how
do
you
not
love
klink
and
schultzi
so
sorri
mr
higgin
but
as
far
as
i
am
concern
hogan
and
his
band
of
hero
beat
you
to
the
punch
as
far
the
â€œhuman
of
the
german
is
concern
thus
no
point
for
ground
break
cultur
revel
2
the
fact
that
the
final
outcom
of
the
stori
was
known
at
the
veri
begin
of
the
stori
took
away
much
of
the
suspens
mysteri
for
me
now
this
is
not
alway
the
case
when
read
about
real
life
event
in
which
the
final
outcom
is
well
known
as
i
have
read
a
lot
of
histor
ficiton
and
real
life
crime
fiction
that
kept
me
at
the
edg
of
my
seat
howev
in
this
case
the
slow
method
plan
of
the
kidnap
just
never
seem
to
pull
me
in
and
so
i
found
the
stori
veri
slow
move
3
there
were
no
nada
zero
omg
moment
in
the
stori
which
is
a
real
let
down
for
me
as
i
would
have
expect
some
in
a
taut
thriller
of
this
kind
for
me
omg
moment
are
those
moment
that
rais
goos
bump
on
your
skin
e
g
jack
nicholson
on
the
stand
in
a
few
good
men
or
someth
that
happen
that
make
you
say
no
way
did
that
just
happen
e
g
for
those
that
have
seen
the
blair
witch
project
the
final
scene
made
me
almost
crap
my
pant
basic
they
are
memor
scene
that
stick
to
my
brain
long
after
i
have
forgotten
everyth
els
about
the
book
movi
etc
this
book
did
not
have
a
singl
moment
that
will
stay
with
me
for
more
than
10
minut
after
i
finish
this
review
thus
no
point
there
4
final
while
most
of
the
charact
were
well
drawn
there
wasnâ€™t
what
i
would
call
ani
real
standout
charact
this
is
close
tie
to
3
abov
liam
devlin
the
ira
commando
come
closest
and
is
certain
a
good
charact
howev
when
i
finish
the
book
i
wasnâ€™t
anxious
to
pick
up
the
sequel
and
find
out
what
liam
would
do
next
he
just
didn
t
stir
the
curious
in
me
final
thoughtsso
i
didn
t
love
this
book
i
thought
it
was
okay
sometim
when
i
dislik
a
book
that
the
major
of
my
fellow
reader
rate
high
i
will
either
be
think
to
myself
â€˜what
the
hell
were
those
peopl
hop
up
to
rate
this
dung
pile
so
high
and
how
can
i
score
me
some
of
thatâ€™
or
i
ll
be
think
â€˜okay
i
m
the
dung
pile
and
must
have
miss
someth
or
bang
my
head
to
hard
as
a
child
becaus
i
seem
to
be
clear
mistaken
on
this
one
â€™
well
in
this
case
i
donâ€™t
think
it
s
either
though
my
status
as
a
dung
pile
is
certain
open
to
daili
re
interpret
i
complet
understand
how
someon
can
love
this
book
and
at
the
same
time
am
veri
comfort
with
my
â€œit
was
just
assess
so
for
all
of
the
abov
reason
i
just
never
found
myself
pull
into
this
one
there
were
some
part
i
like
and
it
certain
had
some
moment
but
there
were
not
enough
of
the
goodi
for
me
to
be
abl
to
say
i
like
it

it
may

onli
one
war

what
a
hero
he
made
up
for

i
read
found
all
german
to
be
on

board

i
believ
that
kurt

did
lead
that
outrag
mission
3
charact
portrait
the
writer
did
research
thorough
for
almost
all
charact
can
be
found
by
a
simpl
googl
search
read
about
worthi
to
rememb
that
this
materi
wouldn
t
show
up
becaus
of
what
it
meant
so
detail
are
graini
but
there
what
is
also
stupend
is
that
each
charact
i
mean
each
everyon
of
them
was
essenti
to
the
plot
what
i
enjoy
most
was
the
brotherhood
amongst
these
warrior
each
everyon
a
just
soldier
unlik
what
we
know
german
to
be
i
felt
sad
everi
time
as
the
narrat
would
reach
the
alreadi
foregon
conclus
that
all
of
them
were
to
be
kia

my
second
favorit
charact
god
bless
him
with
a
great
sens
of
humor
in
fact
all
irish
men
seem
to
have
it
he
seem
to
have
the
most
of
it
in
the
whole
book
devlin
onli
onc
was
genuin
sad
otherwis
it
seem
to
me
that
god
gave
him
a
littl
more
of
the
happi
hormon
none
of
the
sad
one
he
show
what
the
war
did
in
term
of
choic

i
have
come
to
believ
that
one

conclus
i
don

think
i
will
ever
read
anoth
book
from
higgin
as
i
am
afraid
he
will
let
me
down
i
also
think
that
they
should
remak
the
movi
the
earlier
one
was
made
in
the
80s
but
this
generat
must
be
given
a
chanc
to
see
german
in
a
differ
light
i
am
not
say
i
have
turn
for
i
hate
read
about
what
all
they
did
himmler
was
satan
on

as
he
went
about
his
wretch
way
even
in

were

wwii

read
in
2012
i
think
iâ€™v
read
this
book
befor
and
seen
the
movi
but
i
read
it
when
i
was
in
high
school
or
junior
highâ€”long
enough
ago
that
iâ€™d
forgotten
the
detail
if
it
were
written
today
it
would
probabl
have
a
tighter
pov
and
fewer
page
spent
on
the
set
up
still
itâ€™
an
awesom
book
not
squeaki
clean
pg
13
but
cleaner
than
averag
for
the
market
i
think
what
impress
me
most
about
this
book
is
the
way
higgin
creat
sympathi
for
so
mani
charactersâ€”even
though
most
of
the
charact
are
i

although
the

probabl
has
the
most

and
inde
return
in

s
no

and

includ

kind
of

that
