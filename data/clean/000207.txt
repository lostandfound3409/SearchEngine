in

plan
the

by
j
david
stem
joe

has
the
same
fun
that
shrek
did
in
play
against
our
expect
who
would
anticip
a
fight
between
the
ogr
and
his

with
shrek

there
s
real
sweet
when
shrek

start

the
movi
has
sever
song
none
of
which
i
found
veri
memor
although
of
cours
i
am
the
same
person
who
said
the
simon
and
garfunkel
song
in
the
graduat
were
instant
forgett
the
first
song
accident
in
love
explain
how
shrek
and
fiona
fell
for
each
other
it
s
cut
like
a
music
video
which
is
ok
but
i
think
it
come
too
earli
in
the
film
befor
we
realli
feel
at
home
with
the
narrat
a
few
minor
charact
from
the
first
film
like
the
gingerbread
man
and
the
three
blind
mice
return
for
the
sequel
and
there
s
a
new
major
charact
puss
in
boot
a
cat
who
seem
to
have
been
rais
on
charl
boyer
movi
and
is
voic
by
antonio
bandera
donkey
and
puss
build
an
enorm
mutual
resent
becaus
each
one
think
he
s
the
star
sequel
have
their
work
cut
out
for
them
some
peopl
think
godfath
part
ii
is
better
than
the
godfath
but
the
first
film
loom
so
tall
in
my
mind
that
i
gave
part
ii
onli
three
star
in
the
same
way
perhap
i
would
have
like
shrek

more
if
the
first
film
had
never
exist
but
i
ll
never
know
still
shrek

is
