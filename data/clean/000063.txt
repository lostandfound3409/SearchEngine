if
we’r
lucki
catcher
in
the
rye
will
never
be
made
into
a
movi
it’
manag
to
avoid
that
fate
for
over
sixti
year
and
hope
it
will
continu
to
do
so
not
everyth
need
to
be
a
movi
and
i
say
that
as
someon
who
love
movi
we
live
in
an
age
where
someth
alway
had
to
be
translat
into
other
thing
and
whoever
own
the
right
happili
take
the
money
that
translat
provid
j
d
saling
was
not
one
of
those
peopl
and
he
never
sold
the
right
for
catcher
in
the
rye
produc
will
continu
to
hunger
for
the
opportun
to
turn
one
of
the
greatest
novel
of
all
time
into
someth
that
can
be
view
in
under
two
hour
but
saling
wasn’t
just
be
stodgi
when
he
refus
to
give
up
the
right
in
a
letter
he
wrote
in
1957
he
list
his
reason
for
whi
he
couldn’t
see
catcher
in
the
rye
as
a
play
or
a
motion
pictur
hit
the
jump
for
his
argument
the
letter
pop
up
onlin
about
two
year
ago
but
for
those
who
didn’t
see
it
cameron
crow
post
a
partial
copi
on
his
websit
yesterday
in
the
letter
saling
list
the
follow
reason
whi
he
doesn’t
think
catcher
in
the
rye
can
be
translat
to
the
stage
or
screen
it’
a
“novelistic”
novel
saling
talk
about
the
asid
of
holden’
thought
like
“gasolin
rainbow
in
street
puddl
his
philosophi
or
way
of
look
at
cowhid
suitcas
and
empti
toothpast
cartons—in
a
way
his
thought
”
the
“immeasur
riski
busi
of
use
actor
”
saling
couldn’t
envis
a
child
actress
play
phoeb
or
a
young
actor
play
holden
becaus
even
if
they
had
“x”
they
wouldn’t
know
what
to
do
with
it
no
director
could
get
the
necessari
perform
from
these
actor
saling
particular
couldn’t
see
the
book
be
done
as
a
stage
play
due
to
the
medium’
technic
limit
one
could
argu
that
saling
simpli
didn’t
have
the
imagin
to
consid
what
could
be
done
with
his
novel
and
it’
imposs
to
know
what
he
would
say
about
a
film
adapt
base
on
how
far
the
medium
has
come
sinc
1957
he
die
in
2010
and
no
record
comment
on
a
catcher
in
the
rye
movi
has
been
found
past
his
letter
but
those
argument
are
besid
the
point
to
be
honest
saling
could
have
simpli
respond
“fuck
you
that’
whi
”
and
it
would
be
a
respect
answer
we
can
dream
about
how
such
and
such
would
make
a
good
movi
or
tv
show
but
the
origin
dreamer
should
alway
have
the
final
say
he
or
she
doesn’t
owe
us
an
explan
but
i
commend
saling
for
provid
his

someon
who
ask
