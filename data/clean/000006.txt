analysi
charl

has
onli
written
two
work

a

a
lot
less
charact
and
subplot
than
a
typic
charl

did
not

it
bought
a
veri

the
entir
novel
then
there
is
the
humor
mani
of
charl
dickens’
novel
held
humor
but
this
book
was
differ
as
it
contain
a

less

but
it
wasn’t
surpris
owe
to
the
histor
context
and
focus
of

yet
dicken
still
