if
there’
ani
novel
that’
just
made
to
have
a
beauti
cover
it’
the
lord
of
the
ring
i
would
think
this
novel
would
be
a
book
designer’
dream
come
true
so
much
inspir
everi
now
and
then
i’ll
take
a
look
back
at
some
book
cover
over
the
year
for
specif
novel
we’v
done
it
with
the
great
gatsbi
the
grape
of
wrath
and
the
sound
and
the
furi
now
let’
take
a
look
at
some
of
the
the
lord
of
the
ring
cover
over
the
year
i
love
this
one
accord
to
the
script
at
the
top
this
is
the
cover
design
for
the
chines
version
of
the
lord
of
the
ring
simpli
beauti
these
cover
might
take
you
back
they’r
one
of
houghton

from
the
earli
day
love
the

version
it’
actual
the
design
for
the
wraparound
of
the
littl
box
that
hold
all
three

this
draw
alon
make
me
want
to
be
an
artist
and
i
hate

becaus
i
suck
at
it
here’
the
requisit

i’m
pretti

i
tri

a
1960s
or
1970s
vibe
to
