the
period
from
1775
the
outbreak
of
the
american
revolut
to
1789
the
storm
of
the
bastill
is
the
turbul
set
of
this
uncharacterist
dicken
novel
it
is
his
onli
novel
that
lack
comic
relief
is
one
of
onli
two
that
are
not

and
is
also
unusu

lack
a

the

much

no

the

paperback
i
was
first
introduc
to
this
book
when
i
was
14
year
old
in
my
8th
grade
english
class
i
found
it
utter
overwhelm
in
it
cast
it
plotlin
it
set
it
theme
and
most
of
all
in
the
intric
web
the
various
relationship
creat
i
onli
understood
three
thing
about
this
book
first
the
two
citi
are
london
and
pari
second
franc
was
convuls
itself
with
the
french
revolut
while
england
was
undergo
chang
that
would
prepar
it
to
enter
the
industri
revolut
third
english
in
dicken
time
did
not
resembl
english
at
the
end
of
the
20th
centuri
but
somehow
seem
similar
to
the
english
use
in
hollywood
epic
movi
from
the
1950s
and
1960s
like
spartacus
ben
hur
the
ten
command
cleopatra
etc
year
later
i
pick
up
this
book
and
reread
it
i
consid
this
a
labor
not
of
love
but
of
duti
this
book
is
so
famous
and
use
so
often
in
english
literatur
class
that
i
felt
i
had
to
read
it
again
for
a
deeper
understand
what
i
got
from
this
book
a
2nd
time
around
is
a
profound
subtl
yet
accur
sociolog
