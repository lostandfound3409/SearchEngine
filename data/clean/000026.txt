i’v
alway
had
a
problem
with
remors
smoker
truth
i
have
an
avers
to
smoker
in
general
sorri
i
find
it
disgust
but
it
take
a
particular
disturb
lack
of
willpow
to
acknowledg
how
harm
smoke
is
hate
yourself
a
littl
bit
for
be
a
smoker
and
yet
continu
to
be
one
i
tri
to
keep
in
mind
the
habitu
pull
of
addict
and
how
behavior
can
be
ingrain
over
time
especi
one
establish
while
young
but
i
just
can’t
come
to
term
with
how
an
actual
grown
person—who
in
all
likelihood
is
at
least
moder
intellig
and
self
possessed—can
have
all
the
fact
at
their
dispos
and
still
put
themselv
and
the
peopl
around
them
in
harm’
way
willpow
is
an
incred
valuabl
trait
unconsci
i
use
it
as
a
measur
stick
for
how
much
i
respect
a
person
few
thing
impress
me
more
than
someon
who
is
abl
to
ignor
their
bias
or
the
easi
way
out
in
order
to
make
logic
more
benefici
choic
like
avoid
delici
fatti
food
in
favor
of
healthier
one
choos
to
skip
a
night
out
in
order
to
finish
someth
for
work
the
next
day
or
decid
to
give
up
smoke
avoid
the
easi
way
out
is
hard
realli
hard
in
some
case
most
of
the
time
take
the
easi
way
out
is
simpli
follow
our
instinct
so
to
disregard
that
feel
in
the
name
of
do
what’
right
is
impress
willpow
affect
how
you
treat
peopl
whether
you’r
on

how
you
perform
at
your
job
whether
you
give
in
to
obsess
and
a
million
other
thing
with
these
higher
level
concern
i
think
i’v
done
pretti
well
i’v
never
been
a
smoker
i
don’t
do
drug
i’v
never
fallen
in
with
bad
peopl
or
bad
influenc
gotten
into
destruct
relationship
or
commit
ani
crime
i
treat
peopl
with
kind
sometim
even
those
who
don’t
deserv
it
my
mother
doesn’t
even
have
ani
stori
of
me
“be
bad”
as
a
child
in
the
grand
scheme
of
thing
i’m
squeaki
clean
becaus
i’v
pride
myself
on
be
abl
to
say
no
to
thing
that
aren’t
good
for
me
in
the
long
run
the
end
result
is
a
life
that’
pretti
vanilla
but
that’
the
cost
of
make
good
choic
recent
though
i
realiz
i’m
not
make
near
as
mani
good
choic
as
i
thought
i’m
in
my
30s
now
despit
the
fact
that
i
don’t
look
it
i’m
woefulli
out

i’v
talk
about
write
a
novel
for
five
year
and
i
haven’t
written
a

i
eat
like
a
colleg
freshman
i’v
bail
on
four
differ
blog
in
six
year
i
don’t
get
into

becaus
i
don’t
realli
do
anyth
essenti
i
live
like
a
sloth
so
while
i’m
not
addict
to
drug
punch
peopl
in
the
face
or
do
dumb
shit
with
even
dumber
peopl
i’m

by
my

right
after

i’m
go

there’
a
littl
person
insid
of
me
who’
fat
sweati
and
roll

becaus
the
sheer
act
of
walk
make
him
wheezi
i
hate
it
my
life
isn’t
out
of
control
by
ani
mean
but
for
someon
who’
taken
so
much
pride
in
his
own
willpow
i’m
a
total
hypocrit
it’
been
a
few
month
sinc
i’v
notic
it
and
it’
been
a
littl
hard
to
take
most
because—much
like
the
smoker
who
can’t
quit—i
recogn
my
own
destruct
behavior
and
i’m
still
do
them
everi
day
i
thought
i
was
better
than
this
if
i
ever
had
a
problem
i
alway
thought
that
i
could
get
rid
of
it
through
sheer
forc
of
will
by
myself
but
then
i
realiz
that
mayb
i
can’t
