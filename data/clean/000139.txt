when
jame
cameron
first
announc
he’d
be
post
convert
titan
for
a
3d
re
releas
in
april
2012
i
was
a
bit
skeptic
after
all
i
think
most
of
us
can
agre
that
post
convert
movi
are
usual
substandard
to
one
be
shot
in
3d
and
sinc
the
movi
is
15
year
old
i
figur
it
would
be
an
insan
challeng
to
get
it
right
howev
earlier
today
i
visit
paramount
in
hollywood
and
got
to
see
about
18
minut
of
the
convert
film
on
the
big
screen
so
what
did
i
learn
never
ever
bet
against
jame
cameron
the
footag
i
saw
this
morn
left
me
speechless
i’m
not
joke
around
when
i
say
it’
the
best
post
convers
i’v
ever
seen
and
it
look
like
they
origin
shot
it
in
3d
back
in
1997
in
addit
cameron
told
us
befor
they
post
convert
they
creat
a
new
4k
master
and
did
a
full
color
correct
and
clean
the
film
so
even
if
you
see
the
film
in
2d
or
3d
in
april
you
will
not
believ
how
crystal
clear
the
imag
are
and
how
good
the
film
look
howev
befor
you
start
to
think
cameron
made
ani
chang
to
the
actual
film
he
told
us
they
are
not
edit
a
singl
scene
he’
not
pull
a
georg
luca
hit
the
jump
for
more
so
you
may
be
ask
whi
cameron
was
abl
to
make
titan
3d
look
so
amaz
when
other
post
convert
movi
miss
the
mark
the
simpl
answer
is
time
and
money
when
a
movi
is
be
film
and
the
studio
has
alreadi
set
a
releas
date
you
have
veri
limit
time
to
post
convert
after
all
if
the
film
use
a
lot
of
cgi
it
take
time
to
get
the
effect
deliv
and
it
also
take
time
to
edit
the
film
add
a
score
and
make
everyth
perfect
you
can’t
do
a
post
convers
until
the
film
is
almost
finish
so
it’
hard
to
get
it
right
with
such
a
small
window
of
time
but
for
titan
cameron
has
been
work
on
the
convers
for
60
week
and
he’
spent
18
million
dollar
that’
more
time
than
anyon
has
ever
spent
on
post
convers
but
it
absolut
show
i
think
as
more
filmmak
and
studio
do
3d
re
releas
they’r
go
to
use
the
templat
set
by
cameron
to
get
it
right
at
least
i
hope
they
do…becaus
what
i
saw
today
was
stun
and
i
have
no
qualm
recommend
this
post
convers
to
everyon
dure
today’
present
they
show
us
8
scene
as
you
might
imagin
cameron
and
produc
jon
landau
pick
moment
from
the
entir
film
and
they
of
cours
show
the
veri
famous
scene
of
leonardo
dicaprio
and
kate
winslet
stand
on
the
front
of
the
ship
as
the
camera
pan
around
them
i
felt
like
i
could
see
actual
depth
howev
my
favorit
scene
was
toward
the
end
of
the
film
when
winslet
is
run
around
the
lower
deck
tri
to
find
someon
to
help
free
dicaprio
from
the
handcuff
as
she
frantic
search
up
and
down
the
long
white
corridor
the
3d
ad
a
whole
new
layer
becaus
the
tight
corridor
made
me
feel
her
claustrophobia
and
desper
trust
me
you
will
be
blown
away
when
you
final
see
this
again
in
3d
anyway
short
after
watch
the
footag
i
record
a
video
blog
with
peter
from
slashfilm
and
alex
from
firstshow
in
the
park
lot
we
talk
about
our
reaction
to
the
footag
and
what
we
took
away
from
the
present
and
unlik
most
of
our
video
blog
this
one
is
relat
short
with

show
us
the

the
peopl
who
hate
titan
are
the
major
they
are
just
the
loudest
titan

superwizardguy
“the

anoth
common
statement
that
realli
annoy
me
consid
he
was
will
to
give
up
his
share
of
titanic’
profit
just
so
he
can
finish
it
to
his
standard
and
not
cut
a
singl
scene
he
didn’t
want
to
cut
doesn’t
indic
greedi
it
indic
a
love
of
filmmak
the
purpos
of
this
re
releas
is
to
of
cours
make
money
but
cameron
want
to
prove
that
post
convers
3d
can
onli
work
if
appropi
effort
is
appli
i
cri
u
smile
cameron
is
not
greedi
he’
just
veri
passion
about
his
work
and
he
realli
love
3d
so
whi
blame
him
for
convert
his
oscar
win
movi
to
3d
jamai
love
how
passion
you
get
steve
thank
for
the
head
up
jymmmymack
i’m
sure
the
convers
is
great
looking…
too
bad
titan
is
still
as
mediocr
today
as
it
was
back
in
’97
if
you
can
look
me
in
the
eye
and
tell
me
that
titan
is
better
than
l
a
confidenti
good
will
hunt

then
you

not
let
me
get
this
straight
if
somebody’

jive

then
they
are

if

they

i

of

titanic’
dialogu
is
somewhat
cheesi
at

but
that
error
is
dwarf
when
you
consid
the
overal

of
the

it
was

the

in

my

he

on

there

of

onli

in

that

that

such

titan

don’t
tell

just
becaus
someon
got
the
ring
cycl
right
onc

it
can
never

again
titan
in
3d
is
akin
to
a
new
product
of
a
familiar
piec
of
work
–
i
person
believ
titan
is
a
time
sturdi
enough
film
to
warrant
this
kind
of
retrospect
it’
a
masterwork
again
like
it
or
not
if
it
were
done
well
enough
i’d
person
be
happi
to
watch

convers
this
is
anoth
film
that
just
stand
up

transcend
cinema
for
that
matter
if
there
was
a
way
to
get
a

qualiti
gone

i’d
check

in

some

a

of
nausea
for
some

higher

i
don’t
see

it
realli
add
to

the

is
there

that’
basic
it
i
give
cameron
credit
he’
determin
to
make
the
world
understand
how
3d
is
the
way
of
futur
but
the
implement
thus
far
is

i
agre
–
the
way
i

it
is
that
although
titan
isn’t
my
person
favourit
film
it
is
one
of
the
greatest
film
ever
made
and
i
hate

titan
is
an

simpl
i
love
it
j
jonah

it’

cameron

may
be

but
there
are
mani
more
other
cast
crew
who
have
and
will
serv

over

over

becaus
he’
a

maker
as

love
it
orgin
still
love
it
and
i’m
sure
i’ll
love
it

kick
jim
cameron’
titan
in

titan
is
like
it
or
not
one
of
the
most
incred
film
to
be
releas
in
the
past
25
30
year
asid
from
pulp
fiction
i
can’t
think
of
anoth
film
that
has
impact
film
and
pop
cultur
more
signific
and
i’m
a
32
year
old
film
fan
i
rememb
in
the
month
lead
up
to
the
releas
in
’97
everyon
was
trip
over
themselv
in
a
hurri
to
call
it
a
failur
14
year
and
the
biggest
box
offic
gross
in
histori
later
those
same
peopl
are
still
tri
to
convinc
peopl
it
isn’t
good
whoop
what
kill
me
is
that
peopl
like
to
s
t
all
over
this
movi
by
refer
to
it
as
a
“chick
flick”
yeah
a
hot
piec
of
a
like
kate
winslet
get
nake
in
a
pg
13
movi
and
hundr
of
peopl
be
brutal
kill
on
screen
is
total
chick
flick
territori
it’
a
histor
epic
with
an
emot
engag
stori
and
still
to
this
day
incred
special
effect
or
as
i
like
to
call
it
just
“a
damn
good
film”
i
don’t
know
whi
peopl
get
all
bent
out
of
shape
about
cameron
or
seem
to
lose
all
sort
of
clariti
or
saniti
when
discuss
his
last
two
film
but
i
think
it
may
be
some
sort
of
weird
fanboy
backlash
he
made
alien
and
the
termin
film
and
everyon
seem
to
agre
those
are
fantast
but
becaus
someth
was
wild
popular
in
a
pop
cultur
way
mean
your
grandma
step
father
and
your
littl
sister
all
agre
titan
was
awesom
now
the
fanboy
has
to
turn
up
his
nose
it’
possibl
that
becaus
of
cameron’
brash
persona
he
come
off
as
arrog
but
when
you
make
the
top
2
highest
gross
film
of
the
past
20
year
and
it”
not
even
close
there
may
be

overal
melimoo
serious
titan
is
an
amaz
film
in
2d
or
3d
so
whoever
think
otherwis
is
just
delussion
it
was
a
real
life
event
that
nobodi
in
this
generat
will
have
seen
or
known
about
in
slight
detail
without
that
film
yeah
it
wasnt
the
real
thing
but
i
doubt
that
anyon
would
want
to
see
the
real
thing
consid
that
it
was
heartbreak
and
a
lot
of
peopl
die
becaus
of
their
class
it
show
how
peopl
were
treat
accord
to
their
class
and
also
about
other
thing
serious
i
think
that
film
is
amaz
and
it
is
my
favourit
film
jame
cameron
is
truli
amaz
for
creat
titan
and
make
it
so
realist
and
all
this
is
come
from
a
16
year
old
girl
whoever
think
bad
of
jame
cameron
then
serious
get
a
grip
he
make
good
film
and
satisfi
a
lot
of
peopl
with
the
film
he
make
if
you
dont
like
jame
cameron
or
the
film
he
make
or
even
the
amount
of
money
he
make
out
of
make
them
then
dont
watch
them
and
stop
critis
what
he
doe
when
a
lot
of
peopl
love
what
he
doe
and
what
he
creat
he
goe
to
a
great
deal
of
troubl
to
make
them
in
such
detail
like
he
did
with
titan
and
if
you
dont
like
it
then
like
