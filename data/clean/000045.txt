an

the

of
fantast

that
have
led
to

build
up
an

of
the
connect

fantasyâ€™
origin
it
touchston
and
it
mani
strand
of
influenc
between
them
j
r
r
tolkien
and
c
s
lewi
have
been
credit
with
reinvent
and
reinvigor
fantasi
literatur
for
the
second
half
of
the
twentieth
centuri
both
creativ
and
ultim
commerci
amaz
the
two
writer
most
influenti
on
modern
fantasi
were
both
professor
of
mediev
languag
and
literatur
at
oxford
univers
as
well
as
be
good
friend
dure
the
period
in
which
they
wrote
respect
the
lord
of
the
ring
and
the
chronicl
of
narnia
both
were
member
of
an
inform
read
and
write
group
known
as
the
inkl
where
they
discuss
their
work
in
progress
and
their
idea
about
fantasi
the
two
were
also
bound
by
the
share
experi
of
fight
in
the
trench
of
world
war
i
and
by
their
devot
to
christian
in
1931
tolkien
was
among
those
who
help
convert
the
atheist
lewi
though
lewi
did
not
embrac
tolkienâ€™
catholic
the
religi
background
of
an
author
is
not
someth
that
will
come
up
often
in
my
survey
of
fantasi
but
in
this
case
it
is
relev
to
an
understand
of
lewisâ€™
work
near
all
of
which
is
relat
to
his
religi
idea
in
some
way
given
their
mani
affin
then
it
may
come
as
a
surpris
that
tolkien
express
strong
dislik
for
the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrob
1950
and
the
six
subsequ
narnia
volum
yet
compar
it
to
tolkienâ€™
work
may
explain
whi
tolkien
after
all
is
herald
as
the
master
of
what
has
come
to
be
known
as
world
build
spend
year
invent
the
languag
histori
and
geographi
of
middl
earth
prior
to
write
the
lord
of
the
ring
this
world
build
is
probabl
the
most
influenti
aspect
of
his
work
it
popular
creat
a
larg
readership
that
would
subsequ
be
accustom
to
accept
secondari
world
fantasiesâ€”stori
set
in
imagin
land
with
no
necessari
connect
to
oursâ€”a
a
genr
in
itself
fan
demand
more
of
it
lead
to
the
fantasi
publish
boom
that
began
after
the
paperback
public
of
the
lord
of
the
ring
in
the
late
â€˜60s
lewisâ€™
narnia
on
the
other
hand
come
across
as
slapdash
by
comparison
with
it
talk
anim
dryad
and
mermaid
faun
and
giant
witch
and
demon
all
thrown
togeth
with
the
christ
lion
aslan
turkish
for
lion
in
the
fantasi
land
of
narnia
lewi
and
tolkien
were
both
lover
and
scholar
of
mytholog
but
they
use
it
in
veri
differ
way
tolkien
build
up
a
consist
and
explain
altern
mytholog
while
lewi
seem
to
impuls
pick
and
choos
bit
and
piec
from
wherev
he
want
it
should
be
rememb
howev
that
lewi
was
write
for
young
children
wherea
tolkien
pursu
a
more
matur
audienc
from
a
childâ€™
perspect
whi
shouldnâ€™t
a
fantasi
land
contain
a
wick
witch
alongsid
a
famili
of
talk
beaver
and
featur
a
seem
random
encount
with
santa
claus
all
the
creatur
in
the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrob
along
with
the
christian
allegor
aspect
would
have
alreadi
been
part
of
a
childâ€™
imagin
world
and
combin
it
all
into
a
singl
stori
where
ani
type
of
wonder
charact
might
be
encount
was
certain
part
of
the
appeal
for
a
nine
year
old
alreadi
familiar
with
the
wizard
of
oz
alic
in
wonderland
and
the
wind
in
the
willow
among
other
childhood
stori
lewisâ€™
narnia
seem
to
me
at
that
age
like
fantasi
of
a
higher
order
anoth
reason
for
the
appeal
and
for
the
subsequ
influenc
of
the
seri
is
the
way
in
which
lewi
heighten
the
bookâ€™
imageri
by
combin
the
realist
with
the
fantast
even
befor
reread
it
for
the
first
time
sinc
that
initi
encount
i
could
vivid
rememb
the
open
chapter
of
the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrob
which
i
first
heard
read
aloud
to
my
fourth
grade
class
the
four
pevensi
children
separ
from
their
parent
after
be
sent
to
a
countri
hous
to
escap
the
london
bomb
of
world
war
ii
discov
the
wardrob
portal
to
narnia
as
they
explor
their
new
home
the
sensat
of
the
fabric
of
the
coat
in
the
back
of
the
dark
wardrob
give
way
to
the
feel
of
tree
branch
the
strang
chang
of
season
as
we
find
that
narnia
has
becom
a
land
of
etern
winter
the
initi
encount
of
luci
with
the
faun
tumnus
and
edmundâ€™
with
the
evil
white
witch
and
the
odd
imag
of
the
lamppost
in
the
snow
outsid
the
wardrob
portalâ€”it
was
these
juxtaposit
of
the
mundan
and
the
fantast
that
seem
so
thrill
and
intrigu
and
which
sent
me
to
the
librari
to
find
the
remain
book
in
the
seri
clear
lewi
struck
a
chord
with
children
as
the
book
and
seri
have
remain
continu
in
print
sell
over
100
million
copi
in
dozen
of
languag
and
have
recent
been
given
a
new
leas
on
life
by
an
ongo
seri
of
film
read
and
reevalu
it
today
itâ€™
import
to
keep
it
intend
audienc
in
mind
itâ€™
subtitl
â€œa
stori
for
after
all
as
iâ€™m
sure
my
fourth
grade
teacher
was
awar
in
choos
to
read
it
to
my
class
age
nine
is
probabl
about
the
right
age
at
which
to
encount
it
tolkienâ€™
appar
object
to
the
mish
mash
of
mytholog
influenc
might
seem
pointless
to
young
reader
but
his
point
is
quit
valid
for
fantasi
reader
look
for
interest
and
consist
world
build
and
who
may
wonder
what
lewi
is
tri
to
get
at
with
this
approach
some
have
interpret
the
world
build
problem
which
includ
some
inconsist
within
the
seri
as
be
the
result
of
rapid
composit
and
lack
of
attent
to
detail
there
may
be
someth
to
thisâ€”al
seven
novel
were
written
between
1949
and
1954
and
public
was
complet
by
1956
and
itâ€™
not
clear
that
lewi
had
the
entir
arc
of
the
seri
in
mind
when
he
wrote
the
first
bookâ€”but
i
think
the
world
he
did
build
is
consist
with
lewisâ€™
own
interest
and
thus
the
aspect
tolkien
and
other
have
object
to
were
to
some
extent
quit
deliber
lewisâ€™
convers
to
christian
came
when
tolkien
and
other
friend
convinc
him
that
christian
belief
was
not
inconsist
with
his
continu
devot
to
his
belov
world
of
mytholog
specif
lewi
came
to
believ
the
pagan
god
of
the
greek
and
roman
were
base
on
a
partial
or
incomplet
revel
of
the
christian
truth
to
these
cultur
thus
give
mytholog
and
fabl
some
valid
within
his
christian
worldview
from
this
perspect
the
appear
of
bacchus
along
with
faun
dryad
fairi
tale
charact
and
other
mytholog
manifest
in
the
same
world
he
would
use
to
relat
a
christian
allegori
doe
not
seem
so
incongru
it
also
explain
whi
mani
childhood
reader
of
the
seri
myself
includ
were
surpris
to
learn
later
of
the
christian
basi
for
the
stori
mix
in
as
it
is
with
so
mani
aspect
that
would
seem
complet
unrel
to
christian
upon
reread
it
this
aspect
of
the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrob
did
becom
obvious
aslan
the
christ
figur
allow
himself
to
be
sacrif
in
order
to
save
edmund
who
has
betray
his
sibl
by
help
the
white
witch
in
exchang
for
magic
candi
and
to
get
back
at
them
for
condemn
his
mean
behavior
the
witch
claim
edmundâ€™
life
under
the
rule
of
â€œdeep
magic
from
the
dawn
of
time
but
is
not
awar
that
aslan
has
access
to
â€œdeeper
magic
from
befor
the
dawn
of
time
which
result
in
the
lionâ€™
resurrect
lead
in
turn
to
the
reclam
of
narnia
from
the
witchâ€™
spell
the
thaw
of
the
multitud
of
creatur
the
witch
has
turn
to
stone
one
of
the
most
memor
imag
in
the
novel
and
the
return
of
summer
aslan
die
for
edmundâ€™
sin
and
is
resurrect
but
the
death
and
rebirth
of
charact
is
not
unusu
in
fantasi
and
the
stori
work
just
as
well
for
reader
unawar
or
uninterest
in
the
christian
aspect
the
messag
of
the
stori
could
just
as
well
be
interpret
as
a
process
of
edmund
learn
the
error
of
his
way
as
he
will
becom
an
import
charact
in
the
remaind
of
the
seri
the
religi
theme
are
also
revisit
throughout
the
seri
especi
in
the
magicianâ€™
nephew
1955
and
the
