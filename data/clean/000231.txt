perfect
articl
spider
man
is
the
hardest
thing
to
screw
up
in
the
world
and
they
have
manag
to
do
it
again
and
again
welcom
home
sidneyspit
and
they
turn
captain
staci
into
a
jerk
too
can
you
imagin

of

“take

as
he
was

“promis
me
you’ll
stay

great
actor
play
staci
but
the
script
was
so
off
stephen
that’
just
like
your
opinion
man
v
the
“less
likable”
spidey
is
a
realli
subject
opinion
as
there
are
an
equal
number
of
peopl
who
favor
andrew
garfield’
turn
as
the
charact
over
tobey
maguire’
the
biggest
drawback
of
the
amaz
spider
man
franchis
was
not
the
actor
director
or
reboot
itself
but
the
incred
weak
script
which
never
did
the
rest
of
the
talent
on
board
enough
justic
alex
w
i
thought
it
was
just
denni
leari
play
himself
chris
taylor
i
didn’t
like
salli
fields’
portray
of
aunt
may
i’d
never
thought
of
aunt
may
as
a

befor
conner
garri
sennett
i
guess
i’m
the
onli
one
who
had
no
issu
with
the
past
two
film
mr
novemb
soni
gave
us
the
perfect
spider
man
film
year
ago
with
spider
man
2
a
great
film
not
just
for
fan
of
the
comic
but
also
for
general
film
audienc
and
critic
strong
write
great
charact
develop
good
act
and
some
fantast
action
scene
made
spider
man
2
one
of
the
best
superhero
film
to
date
and
soni
should
be
prais
for
give
us
that
spider
man
2
and
x2
i
doubt
both
warner
bro’
and
paramount
rememb
without
paramount
marvel
studio
would
never
of
got
off
the
ground
in
time
for
disney
to
buy
it
and
take
all
the
credit
with
would
of
been
motiv
enough
to
give
us
film
we
have
now
frank
after
spider
man
2
ani
sequel
reboot
has
been
a
tough
act
to
follow
i
high
doubt
marvel
will
be
abl
to
top
it
becaus
so
far
marvel
has
made
2
3
truli
great
film
and
lot
of
bad
to
generic
film
where
bad
humour
and
flashi
cgi
cover
up
the
clear
lack
of
charact
develop
and
plot
last
year
fox
made
who
like
soni
made
mistak
decid
to
get
their
act
togeth
and
gave
us
a
film
a
rival
their
best
supehero
film
x2
day
of

past
prove
that
with
patienc
and
care
you
can
make
someth
great
soni
never
learn
that
and
onli
want
to
emul
the

a
strategi
that
will
eventu
be
their
undo
as

fatigu
kick
in

a

competit

aim

better
film
mayb
spider

go
back
to

will
be
a
good
thing
for
spider

howev
unlik
a
lot
of
peopl
i
firm
believ
that
x
men
franchis
is
in
safer
hand
in
a
compani
that
wish
to
compet
with
disney
rather
then
part
of

monopoli
competit
is
good
for

i’d
rather
have

this
articl
suck
andrew’
spiderman
is
just
what
the
aveng
need
tobey’
spidey
was
waaay
to
emot
whi
should
toni
stark
be
the
onli
confid
one
jake
no
the
real
issu
with
the
reboot
was
they
hire
a
hack
roberto
orci
to
write
the
script
worst
writer
in
hollywood
and
sinc
he
got
fire
from
this
and
star
trek
he
has
been
struggl
to
find
work
komickev
i
agre
with
mr
novemb
although
your
write
should
read
“should
have”
and
“would
have”
–
–
you’r
think
should’v
and
spell
it
as
“should
of”
asm2
was
a
great
movi
and
i
think
soni
and
mayb
even
marvel
are
shoot
themselv
in
the
foot
by
not
follow
through
with
andrew
garfield
with
continu
spidey
adventur
larri
i’m
glad
spidey
is
go
to
the
mcu
but
i
love
all
the
movi
expect
for
sm3
sm2
is
my
favorit
for
the
stori
but
garfiled’
portray
was
my
overal
favorit
pete
stancheck
too
bad
the
amaz
spider
man
stori
was
not
finish
we
will
never
know
what
happen
after
part
2
larri
i
thought
they
were
great
so
you’r
not
alon
larri
rememb
avi
arad
claim
that
the
cinemat
univers
was
actual
his
idea
and
not
kevin
feigl
from
the
thing
i’v
read
so
no
direct
knowledg
of

he
is
the
reason
that
sm4
never
happen
sm3
was
aw
and
the
asm
franchis
got
screw
up
he
allow
his
ego
to
come
befor
the
product
billi
fcking
hollywood
…
they
are
so
wrap
up
in
demograph
and
number
they’v
lost
the
basic
human
element
of
an

life
so
fcking
stupid
soni

worthless
i
hope
china
hack
them
next
bring
back
rami
will
of
the
nerd
how
is
this
break
news
or
even
news
i
don’t
know
if
it’
a
glitch
or
someth
but…
eh
anyway…
the
first
reason
isn’t
realli
a
reason
to
me
just
a
nice
piec
of
trivia
i
didn’t
know
hathaway
was
suppos
to
be
black
cat
funni
in
hindsight
i
like
the
first
asm
so
it
didn’t
realli
feel
rush
to
me
i
dunno
i
didn’t
realli
pay
attent
to
news
regard
movi
back
then
so
i
didn’t
even
know
what
was
up
with
all
the
behind
the
scene
shenanigan
it
was
just
a
reboot
becaus
“hey
reboot
”
sinc
a
lot
of
thing
were
get
reboot
at
that
time
i
just
thought
ti
was
part
of
the
trend
i
absolut
agre
regard
the
origin
stori
point
peter’
origin
in
my
eye
begin
and
end
within
the
general
overview
of
uncl
ben’
death
i
don’t
want
some
superspi
conspiraci
nonsens
it’
the
same
problem
i
have
with
burton’
batman
–
take
a
onc
insignific
element
and
tri
to
make
it
someth
more
import
than
it
actual
is
the
second
film’
parker
mysteri
subplot
was
complet
pointless
take
time
away
from
electro
who
desper
need
more
focus
and
better
write
i
thought
they’d
portray
him
as
this
tragic
frail
man
who
had
his
one
good
thing
in
life
taken
from
him
i
dunno
have
peter
activ
fail
to
save
him
from
becom
electro
or
someth
…
instead
he’
an
over
attach
fanboy…
yaaaay
howev
i
disagre
that
garfield’
spidey
was
unlik
i
found
him
veri
likabl
stupid
promis
break
asid
serious
who
wrote
that
scene
and
what
were
they
on
or
did
they
just
watch
batman
begin
and
love
that
stupid
train
scene
part
becaus
garfield
has
much
more
charisma
than
maguir
whose
peter
i
alway
found
incred
annoy
i
didn’t
get
the
impress
garfield’
peter
was
a
nerd
nor
that
he
was
well
like
he
was
just
there
and
a
bit
social
awkward
i
find
that
much
more
compel
than
maguire’
veri
typic
nerdi
peter
i
am
100
with
you
on
the
last
point
though

while

had
a
coupl
of
major
problem
that
the
marvel
and
x
franchis
found
way
to
avoid
and
that
soni
never
even
notic
first
when
retel
the
origin
they
decid
that
the
raimi
spiderman
movi
were
bad
and
threw
out
as
much
as
possibl
and
end
up
with
someth
unrecognis
as
they
had
noth
realli
to
replac
it
with
compar
first
class
which
had
a
new
origin
but
set
it
so
much
earlier
that
the
chang
weren’t
as
problemat
if
they
had
simpli
did
asm
with
a
2
min
pre
credit
sequenc
of
ag
get
bit
gain
his
power
to
reinforc
that
it
was
the
same
charact
then
they
could
have
ignor
what
didn’t
work
and
kept
what
did
instead
they
start
from
scratch
believ
that
there
target
audienc
wasn’t
still
watch
the
last
origin
the
second
major
problem
was
that
they
decid
to
come
up
with
origin
charact
and
name
them
after
the
comic
book
villain
so
you
wind
up
with
an
electro
and
rhino
that
differ
so
much
that
all
the
exist
merchandis
an
comic
book
could
never
be
use
for
public
purpos
the
last
movi
that
did
this
were
the
fantast
four
and
x
men
origin
wolverin
and
both
flop
instead
of
find
a
charact
like
kraven
whose
costum
and
motiv
would
easili
fit
in
without
major
chang
they
appear
to
have
cast
accord
to
oscar
qualif
and
wrote
the
charact
as
part
of
the
one
off
plot
and
the
fact
that
if

hadn’t
been

…batman

anyon
toni

maguir
was
a
great
peter
parker
but
a
bad
spider
man
garfield
was
the
opposit
of
that
hector
b
lop
realli
i
don’t
understand
whi
mani
peopl
like
spiderman
2
and
say
it’
one
of
the
best
movi
in
superhero
time
in
my
opinion
is
the
one
that
start
screw
all
the
franchis
these
on
the
worst
for
me
a
lot
more
than
spiderman
3
it’
full
of
flaw
1
the
real
villain
were
the
“evil
tentacles”
as
i
rememeb
doc
oc
is
suppos
to
be
a
mad
and
evil
doctor
not
a
good
guy
who
was
control
by
the
creepi
tentacl
2
the
scene
with
aunt
may
struggl
with
doc
oc
at
the
builid
is
as
stupid
as
a
transform
sequel
scene
from
michael
bay
3
spiderman
loos
his
power
becaus
he
was
depress
it
onli
weakend
so
hard
peter
parker’
charact
4
the
trio
partner
best
friend
romanc
triangl
relationship
that
was
develop
between
harri
mari
jane
and
peter
was
so
disgust
realli
a
romanc
trio
with
the
futur
hobglobin
that
when
i
saw
the
asm’
movi
i
felt
a
great
sensat
of
relief
and
satisfact
in
that
way
how
they
did
the
gwen
peter
relat
is
far
superior
from
the
first
trilog
simon
austin
i
think
you
misinterpret
they
gave
garfield
prop
for
play
peter
they’r
disconnect
charact
from
actor
and
talk
about
the
charact
here
the
peter
in
raimi’
film
was
a
normal
dorki
kid
who
was
given
a
chanc
at
great
genuin
love
and
care
was
shown
for
his
uncl
apart
from
the
obvious
fall
out
his
aunt
his
friend
and
mj
he
was
over
emot
sure
but
the
fact
that
emot
stem
a
lot
of
the
time
from
tri
to
do
good
deed
gave
him
a
likabl
by
comparison
imo
the
spidey
of
asm
film
is
an
cool
dude
wise
crack
cocki
jackass
garfield
is
a
more
likeabl
actor
than
maguir
but
imo
the
charact
he
was
play
was
not
larri
oliv
i
still
consid
spider
man
2
the
best
film
base
on
a
marvel
charact
spiderclaw
everyon
is
stupid
movi
fan
who
know
noth
of
the
sourc
and
column
writer
who
know
noth
but
at
least
this
guy
made
some
good
point
and
realiz
that
this
is
good
for
everyon
with
marvel
involv
this
will
give
us
a
chanc
to
see
the
comic
spidey
come
to
life
some
comment
on
here
say
spiderman2
from
raimi
was
perfect
but
it
wasn’t
it
had
the
same
problem
the
rest
had
they
all
left
out
what
make
spidey
popular
in
comic
his
mouth
they
hint
at
it
in
the
1st
asm
but
never
realli
got
it
right
his
mouth
never
stop
he
just
has
that
comic
banter
go
on
dure
his
fight
and
doesn’t
stop
until
his
bad
guy
are
beat
or
have
a
seizur
from
the
inan
banter
as
they
see
it
he
should
keep
us
roll
on
the
floor
and
i
believ
that
marvel
will
see
to
that
adaminoregon
the
mistak
was
make
the
second
film
a
set
up
for
anoth
film
with
6
villiain
when
will
they
learn
one
villain
a
movi
should
be
enough
the
way
these
second
movi
treat
norman
osborn
made
no
sens
he
is
sm’s
greatest
villain
and
they
show
him
for
one
scene
then
he
die
and
the
way
they
treat
electro’
power
made
no
sens
but
thank
god
we
didn’t
get
ann
hatheway
as
black
cat
that
would
have
been
hideous
larri
oliv
best
part
of
asm2
was
peter
and
gwen
it
could
have
been
just
them
and
i
would
have
enjoy
the
film
problem
was
they
play
the
romanc
stuff
for
real
but
made
the
villain
campi
bad
motiv
moron
harri
osborn
should
have
been
introduc
in
the
first
film
and
becom
the
goblin
in
asm2
as
the
sole
villain
also
andrew
garfield
was
great
as
spider
man
terribl
as
peter
blame
the
script
for
make
him
selfish
and
whini
avi
raimi
seem
to
have
lost
the
plot
follow
spider
man
2
i
still
believ
alfr
molina
play
the
best
on
screen
villain
in
a
superhero
movi
but
otherwis
i
don’t
see
the
appeal
of
the
origin
trilog
andrew
garfield
and
emma
stone
individu
and
togeth
prove
better
than
tobi
macguir
who
i
love
in
sea
biscuit
but
not
as
peter
parker
and
kirsten
dunst
the
worst
comic
book
movi
femal
charact
yes
more
than
viper
or
x3
jean
spider
man
realli
came
aliv
in
the
webb
movi
with
the
humor
and
romanc
of
the
sourc
on
mark
where
they
fail
was
less
than
stellar
villain
work
lizard
deserv
the
famili
background
while
electro
need
more
of
peopl
power
against
ridicul
dub
step
soundtrack
and
costum
–
dane
as
harri
was
an
excel
choic
but
need
more
breath
room
while
i’m
saliv
at
the
thought
of
a
new
aveng
san
wolvi
i’m
miss
garfield
and
stone
onward
to
the
futur
avi
i
thought
they
captur
the
comic
well
but
the
villain
need
more
depth
and
pace
was
a
serious
issu
the
spider
blood
thing
was
also
someth
i
wasn’t
in
favor
of
dave
mcneill
i’m
with
you
guy
i
love
the
new
‘ultimate’
take
on
the
charact
and
i
complet
disagre
with
the
article’
author
due
to
the
fact
that
it
was
alway
lose
uncl
ben
that
made
peter
into
the
hero
we
all
love
not
the
fact
that
he
was
bulli
at
school
kanak
tripathi
this
onli
this
spidey
banter
dave
the
articl
wasn’t
bash
the
actor
it
was
bash
the
studio’
take
of
the
charact
peter
parker
if
anyth
the
articl
prais
andrew
garfield’
act
abil
and
cite
that
the
studio
wast
his
talent
with
lack
of
foresight
i
thought
the
articl
was
spot
on
by
say
that
peter
parker’
stori
is
more
about
grow
up
and
believ
in
yourself
as
oppos
to
be
a
guy
with
super
power
with
immens
daddi
issu
guest
salli
wasn’t
a
great
choic
for
the
role
a
sexi
aunt
may
doesn’t
fit
steven
irizarri
no
he
isnt
robert
stockton
yes
i
agree…
i
don’t
blame
garfield
at
all
just
write
i
mean
how
hard
can
it
be
just
stay
true
to
the
comic
it’
like
these
peopl
didn’t
read
the
book
at
all
just
the
overview
bring
us
the
spider
man
we
want
i
person
enjoy
andrew
as
peter
just
bad
writing…
and
for
the
love
of
god
bring
us
venom
and
carnag
steven
irizarri
no
it
wasnt
it
was
poor
written
and
act
drfurbal
to
be
fair
the
thing
about
peter
lose
his
power
becaus
of
stress
came
straight
from
the
comic
the
first
sinist
six
stori
to
be
precis
same
with
the
peter
harri
mj
triangl
although
i
think
the
comic
threw
gwen
in
as
well
…which
wasn’t
even
present
in
“spider
man
mj
was
engag
to
john
jameson
throughout
the
movi
i
do
agre
that
the
amaz
film
handl
the
romanc
much
better
than
the
origin
trilog
avi
i
love
that
they
did
the
gwen
staci
tragedi
storylin
and
peter
isn’t
a
perfect
guy
you
understand
whi
he
would
want
to
be
with
gwen
even
after
the
captain
told
him
not
to
he
struggl
with
it
throughout
the
film
and
paid
for
it
in
the
end
classic
parker
luck
peopl
think
peter
becam
a
hero
just
for
not
stop
uncl
ben
but
i
believ
peter
becam
spider
man
the
day
he
walk
away
from
kill
the
person
who
lost
him
his
one
true
love
jason
michael
i
doubt
that
the
creativ
reason
cite
in
the
articl
had
much
to
do
with
the
revers
to
marvel
studio
and
that
the
main
reason
is
that
marvel
want
to
integr
their
properti
whi
wouldn’t
they
want
to
be
abl
to
bring
spidey
into
the
aveng
or
ani
other
film
they
choos
it
just
give
them
more
freedom
jeffrey
westhoff
how
soni
lost
it
way
with
spider
man
can
be
sum
up
in
two
word
avi
arad
so
whi
isn’t
he
mention
in
the
articl
lola
mento
santo
andrew
garfield
didn’t
want
to
be
spiderman
anymor
becaus
emma
stone
wasn’t
go
to
be
in
a
third
movi
be
that
she
was
kill
in
the
movi
plus
andrew
is
31
already…
jame
el
puto
i
think
spiderman
will
be
see
next
in
captain
america
becaus
is
too
late
for
him
to
be
in
aveng
2
age
of
ultron
ian
o’hara
i
miss
jk
simmon
as
jj
hope
he
return
in
the
spidey
film
robert
stockton
i
just
don’t
get
how
anyon
can
mess
up
a
movi
base
on
a
comic
book
all
you
have
to
do
is
actual
sit
down
and
read
it
then
pick
a
writer
that
know
how
to
translat
it
to
the
big
screen
but
yet
time
and
time
again
we
see
it
get
mess
up
i
love
andrew
garfield
as
spidey
just
grab
a
coupl
of
writer
that
know
their
stuff
and
plug
them
in
and
make
sure
they
stay
true
to
the
book
give
us
one
villain
not
six
keep
it
simpl
jeez
their
alway
tri
to
do
too
much
and
oversel
us
someth
that
we
don’t
need
to
be
sold
on
swap
actor
again
is
stupid
and
yes
i
agre
garfield
peter
was
a
littl
arrog
but
that’
write
not
on
him
and
i’m
cool
with
garfield
peter
be
social
awkward
and
a
loner
than
him
be
a
nerd
or
dork
i
hope
spider
man
get
back
on
track
this
franchis
deserv
better
and
we
the
fan
deserv
better
give
us
venom
and
carnag
that’ll
be
a
good
start
asm1
was
realli
good
and
yes
the
write
at
time
lack
and
could’v
been
better
but
i’m
not
blame
andrew
one
bit
i
person
think
they
should
show
a
group
of
hardcor
spidey
fan
the
final
cut
of
the
movi
befor
releas
it
to
the
big
screen
to
improv
on
it
and
get
them
to
sign
a
gag
order
or
just
a
hardcor
director
that’
a
hug
spidey
fan
like
raimi
ian
hunter
i
enjoy
all
of
the
film
as
they
all
we
entertain
i
think
sam
raimi’
film
were
definit
more
faith
to
the
charact
asid
from
a
coupl
inconsist
the
use
of
organ
web
left
out
spidey’
trademark
struggl
of
run
out
of
web
the
origin
stori
was
well
told
especi
sinc
they
gave
peter
parker
a
reason
for
his
arrog
at
the
begin
spider
man
2
remain
in
my
opinion
the
best
of
all
spider
man
movi
to
date
still
with
all
of
the
resourc
avail
they
should
have
been
abl
to
do
it
right
without
as
mani
modif
as
they
made
in
both
version
by
now
the
ship
has
sail
for
make
much
of
an
impact
with
the
retel
of
his
origin
see
him
cross
over
with
the
aveng
should
be
cool
if
they
do
it
right
j
p
ducey
i
didn’t
mind
soni
retel
the
origin
but
they
complet
screw
it
up
when
you
chang
the
classic
line
“with
great
power
come
great
responsibility”
your
ask
for
troubl
amaz
spider
man
was
the
worst
spidey
flick
ever
calvinballpro
denni
leari
onli
ever
play
himself
it’
the
part
where
he’
been
abl
to
do
it
for
30
year
now
and
get
away
with
it
that’
so
baffl
calvinballpro
andrew
garfield
play
spider
man
as
if
he
was
a
bulli
rather
than
a
victim
of
bulli
that’
a
problem
jay
the
secret
to
keep
the
spider
man
franchis
was
just
to
make
good
self
contain
film
soni
was
follow
the
wrong
model
instead
of
follow
the
aveng
and
tri
and
build
a
univers
they
should
just
be
like
the
jame
bond
film
just
keep
make
them
like
what
you’r
audienc
want
get
as
much
as
you
can
out
of
an
actor
and
then
chang
actor
without
a
big
fuss
in
the
film
sidneyspit
mayb
so
but
chang
that
aspect
of
the
stori
was
the
absolut
worst
script
mistak
in
the
entir
franchis
what
a
great
moment
in
the
comic
transform
into
someth
meaningless
and
forgett
just
sad
that
ani
writer
could
have
made
such
a
stori
decis
jay
are
you
forget
the
scene
where
he
got
bulli
mickael
duncan
i
think
garfield
was
a
better
spider
man
but
a
terribl
peter
parker
but
it’
not
his
fault…when
you
start
by
cast
a
guy
with
male
model
look
that
radiat
a
confid
person
you’v
complet
miss
the
point
of
the
charact
mickael
duncan
explain
whi
the
amaz
seri
forgot
to
catch
ben’
killer
then
chad
becaus
by
not
catch
his
killer
we
get
to
see
spider
man
transit
from
“on
go
out
to
tri
to
get
reveng
on
the
killer”
to
“go
out
to
hero
for
it
own
sake”
mickael
duncan
actually…th
green
goblin
die
in
the
comic
right
after
he
kill
gwen
so
peter
never
had
that
hero
moment
you
are
talk
about
in
the
asm
movi
peter
never
even
caught
ben’
killer
and
in
my
opinion
it
was
much
more
tragic
for
peter
to
have
lost
gwen
after
promis
a
die
captain
staci
that
he
would
look
after
her
rather
than
becaus
he
was
be
selfish
mickael
duncan
i’m
still
tri
figur
out
what
happen
in
part
2
tomax
while
i
didn’t
realli
have
a
problem
with
garfield
i
did
have
a
problem
with
the
script
and
the
retel
and
forc
angl
they
chose
to
take
in
amaz
i
hate
this
spider
man
he
seem
mean
spirit
and
bent
on
reveng
against
a
world
that
saw
him
as
a
social
outcast
the
same
theme
that
make
most
bad
guy
bad
mickael
duncan
you
mean
creat
a
timelin
for
dozen
of
interconnect
movi
befor
come
up
with
one
that
general
audienc
agre
is
even
good
is
not
a
good
plan
i
am
shock
shock
i
say
dudley
sf
gardfield
was
good
as
spider
man
but
he
was
too
“cool”
and
hipster
to
be
peter
mickael
duncan
imagin
if
thano
were
to
bring
symbiot
with
him
when
he
invad
earth
mickael
duncan
i
blame
the
cast
director
for
hire
a
male
model
ooz
confid
to
play
a
shi
nerd
mickael
duncan
for
the
record
they
film
that
shwarma
scene
from
the
origin
aveng
after
it
had
alreadi
come
out
oversea
queerjock2
i
agre
with
peter
be
less
likabl
but
the
skater
thing
was
not
one
of
them
high
school
is
not
like
it
was
in
the
60’s
where
be
a
nerd
or
outsid
meant
you
wore
sweater
vest
and
thick
coke
bottl
glass
the
fact
that
he
skateboard
and
has
nice
hair
in
no
way
preclud
him
from
be
bulli
or
not
well
like
travi
the
biggest
problem
with
the
asm
film
and
i’ll
still
take
them
over
the
raimi
trilog
ani
day
of
the
week
is
that
they
tri
to
adapt
classic
spider
man
stori
while
complet
revers
them
at
the
same
time
the
most
onli
interest
thing
about
the
peter
gwen
relationship
was
that
she
love
peter
and
hate
spider
man
that
dramat
tension
fed
the
stori
and
make
it
particular
heartbreak
when
she
was
kill
becaus
not
onli
did
she
die
in
peter’
arm
she
didn’t
even
know
it
in
contrast
movi
gwen
dive
headfirst
into
a
situat
far
too
danger
for
her
after
repeat
be
warn
that
it’
far
too
danger
for
her
and
the
obvious
happen
as
a
result
i
know
“yay
progress
blah
blah
blah
”
but
it’
a
far
less
compel
stori
likewis
they
basic
follow
the
same
plot
beat
for
captain
staci
but
come
to
a
complet
differ
conclus
where
staci
tell
peter
to
stay
away
from
gwen
rather
than
to
take
care
of
her
so
the
movi
get
turn
around
ultim
go
to
the
same
place
as
the
comic
but
tri
to
get
there
by
walk
in
the
opposit
direct
dregj
total
agre
he
was
confid
to
the
point
of
be
slap
abl
and
he
was
quit
creepi
when
he
smile
he
just
wasn’t
peter
parker
at
all
those
movi
were
just
dumb
rememb
the
scene
when
he
goe
to
lex
corp
oscorp
evil
inc
to
find
out
about
his
parent
and
instead
find
a
room
with
great
big
danger
look
machin
and
web
everi
where
so
he
think
”
i’ll
screw
around
in
here
for
a
while”
just
becaus
the
plot
demand
it
retributi0n
they
said
they
believ
garfield
is
a
good
enough
actor
that
he
deserv
anoth
shot
and
that
the
stori
itself
is
what
made
his
peter
parker
seem
that
way
not
garfield
himself
but
the
script
and
stori
retributi0n
in
what
iter
of
spider
man
is
he
not
actual
good
look
though
even
tobi
was
an
attract
male
mayb
not
as
much
but
still
in
everi
differ
piec
of
spider
man
media
i
have
seen
peter
parker
has
been
an
attract
guy
but
still
an
outcast
it’
veri
possibl
to
have
both
you
just
have
to
make
sure
you
find
an
actor
who
can
pull
it
off
i
am
favor
logan
lerman
at
the
moment
i
think
he
can
pull
off
awkward
while
still
be
an
attract
guy
plus
it
also
will
bring
in
more
femal
as
well
who
might
not
normal
be
into
comic
like
some
other
femal
retributi0n
the
one
thing
i
like
about
the
past
two
film
is
the
actual
look
of
spider
man
i
will
never
forget
in
the
origin
trailer
for
the
first
film
spidey
was
on
the
bridg
with
a
backpack
and
he
was
stand
in
the
exact
pose
you
often
see
in
the
comic
stori
wise
meh
jay
stand
up
to
bulli
doe
not
make
you
a
bulli
the
differ
between
maguir
spiderman
and
garfield’
immens
superior
version
i
think
is
highlight
by
the
contrast
in
how
their
charact
handl
see
folk
bulli
in
the
film
the
much
laud
raimi
spiderman
2
for
instanc
has
imho
the
worst
scene
i’v
ever
had
the
displeasur
to
sit
through
in
term
of
what
it
turn
the
lead
charact
into
that
moment
where
peter’
been
lose
his
power
see
an
old
man
be
beaten
up
and
coward
slink
away
without
ever
object
to
it
let
alon
interven
was
a
sicken
misunderstand
of
the
charact
especi
given
that
this
is
after
he’d
lost
his
uncl
ben
from
not
interven
spiderman’
lost
his
power
mani
mani
time
in
the
book
and
not
let
it
stop
him
from
go
up
against
super
power
threat
let
alon
some
basic
thug
heck
the
90es
cartoon
had
him
take
on
the
sinist
six
when
he
had
lost
his
power
ani
normal
decent
person
never
mind
someon
who’
suppos
to
be
a
heroic
charact
would
have
interven
and
in
amaz
spiderman
we
see
garfield’
peter
do
just
that
at
the
begin
of
the
film
befor
he’
even
got
ani
superpow
as
you
have
a
scene
where
he
won’t
let
flash
thompson
bulli
the
other
school
kid
even
if
it
mean
he’
go
to
get
a
beat
as
well
that
is
peter
parker
garfield
webb
put
the
hero
back
into
the
super
hero
of
spiderman
wherea
it
seem
like
raimi
maguire’
take
onli
had
him
do
that
if
he
had
power
or
was
look
to
impress
mari
jane
i’m
realli
go
to
miss
see
my
favourit
comic
book
charact
final
be
portray
as
the
admir
strong
charact
he
was
in
the
book
andrew
garfield’
take
realli
was
the
first
time
i
felt
i
could
like
the
charact
on
screen
and
i’ll
alway
be
thank
that
we
at
least
got
to
see
that
proper
brought
to
life
in
these

famous
genius

to
do
someth

just
a
dumb
genius
who
onli
knew
to

use
his

instead
of

forc
to
defeat

in

but
you
guy
complain
about
the
asm

he
didn’t

like

plotwist22
what
a
way
to
typecast
a

have
a
preset
look
nor
attitud
andrew
garfield
was
veri
shi
as
peter
parker
in
the
movi
he
got
hard
time
tell
gwen
his
feel
in
both
movi
and
he
had
proper
use
of
his
nerd
brain
if
that’
not
be
nerd
then
i
don’t
know
what
it
is
someguy
salli
field
was
veri
much
in
line
with
ultim
aunt
may
someguy

blame
you
for

that
but
i
would
go
with
winter
soldier
and
dofp
someguy
no
electro’
look
was
fine
and
recogniz
it
was
his
write
and
act
which
were
annoy
if

yellow
clad
clown
would
work
on

the
amaz
spider
man
film
or
at
least
didn’t
pay
attent
the
storylin
they
claim
audienc
weren’t
expos
to
in
the
first
film
were
thing
i
complet
understood
after
watch
it
and
claim
that
andrew
garfield’
spider
man
is
less
likabl
than
tobi
maguire’
even
after
spider
man
3
that’
just
nonsens
the
problem
with
webb’
amaz
spider
man
film
begin
and
end
with
the
amaz
spider
man
2
which
is
still
a
solid
film
and
didn’t
deserv
the
thrash
it
got
from
some
critic
no
need
to
crap
all
over
andrew
garfield
who
is
still
the
best
spidey
audienc
have
ever
had
jarvi
the
script
for
amaz
spider
man
was
vast
superior
to
the
stilt
over
monologu
y
dreck
that
compris
the
script
for
everi
singl
raimi
spider
man
film
raimi’
spider
man
2
is
still
a
good
film
but
it
manag
that
feat
despit
the
script
not
becaus
of
it
raimi’
first
spider
man
film
is
garish
and
corni
for
most
of
it
run
time
and
spider
man
3
is
just
cheesi
and
amateurish
penguintruth
the
problem
was
that
asm2
much
like
spider
man
3
tri
to
cram
in
too
much
and
accomplish
noth
in
addit
to
just
tri
to
be
differ
for
the
sake
of
be
differ
and
yet
it
was
a
lot
of
the
same
at
the
same
time
you
know
no
more
origin
just
jump
into
thing
just
a
new
adventur
we
know
how
spider
man
came
to
be
you
can
sum
it
up
in
the
open
credit
it’
elementari
materi
just
don’t
cram
in
forti
storylin
garfield
was
fine
as
pete
and
spidey
he
was
just
in
a
forgett
movi
and
a
terribl
one
he
shouldn’t
be
punish
for
the
writer
an
directors’
fault
but
at
least
they
made
gwen
staci
into
a
charact
and
not
some
shine
pedest
like
her
comic
book
counterpart
tomchri
agre
one
of
the
most
perplex
imag
of
“spider
man
was
the
sight
of
tobey
maguire’
peter
parker
still
put
around
town
in
his
mope
his
head
protect
like
a
good
lil’
safeti
conscious
citizen
you’d
thing
a
guy
who
had
a
life
alter
experi
turn
into
a
human
spider
has
face
death
numer
time
and
spend
his
day
swing
around
tall
build
in
spandex
would
have
grown
out
of
such
a
nerdi
look
travel
mode
but
not
the
peter
parker
in
sam
raimi’
univers
who
after
two
amaz
adventur
was
still
a
man
child
you’r
right
andrew
garfield’
parker
spider
man
was
more
confid
and
outward
funni
two
good
script
with
no
origin
and
soni
would
have
had
no
problem
kevinjwood
my
point
is
that
the
cartoon
sticker
album
comic
and
merchandis
relat
to
spiderman
all
featur
as
electro
a
white
guy
in
a
green
and
yellow
costum
so
have
a
black
actor
in
a
black
costum
with
glow
blue
skin
meant
that
they
lost
the
opportun
of
audienc
recognit
compar
for
exampl
the
way
that
loki
wear
those
enorm
horn
on
his
head
which
featur
heavili
in
comic
base
merchandis
so
that
the
charact
was
recognis
or
the
the
scarecrow
in
the
batman
movi
who
is
the
villain
in
all
3
of
them
who
wear
a
recognis
version
of
his
costum
so
that
when
you
read
a
comic
or
buy
a
sticker
set
you
know
who
he
is
and
rememb
all
the
problem
with
prepubl
among
fan
when
galactus
was
chang
from
a
giant
man
in
a
costum
to
a
cloud
back
to
asm2
if
they
had
chang
the
name
to
dick
maxwel
electropuls
it
would
make
no
differ
to
anyth
and
nobodi
would
think
oh
that
just
electro
with
a
differ
name
mile
goodison
fearon
the
problem
with
asm
2
in
particular
was
1
have
the
movi
focus
on
oscorp
but
no
norman
osborn
at
all
instead
we
get
him
show
up
for
a
few
minut
to
appar
die
and
then
stupid
made
harri
the
green
goblin
befor
his
father
i
won’t
even
get
into
how
bad
the
costum
design
was
on
a
sidenot
we
could
have
seen
how
chris
cooper’
take
on
osborn
would
have
interact
with
peter
gwen
harri
aunt
may
and
so
on
but
webb
and
soni
blew
a
golden
opportun
to
let
that
happen
and
instead
we
got
emo
goblin
in
harry’
iter
2
no
jjj
or
the
daili
bugl
as
well
as
that’
also
an
integr
part
of
the
spider
mytho
they
could
have
spent
less
time
with
twilight
soap
opera
dynam
between
gwen
and
peter
and
found
a
way
to
see
peter
work
at
the
daili
bugl
and
put
up
with
jjj
there
were
other
gripe
but
these
were
the
main
2
i
had
so
far
butters911
you
guy
are
crazi
asm
2
may
not
have
been
perfect
but
it
still
made
over
700
million
worldwid
and
andrew
garfield
was
amaz
as
spidey
he
actual
quip
alex
evan
i
was
happi
with
salli
field
i
had
more
of
a
problem
with
martin
sheen’
uncl
ben
who
general
seem
to
come
off
as
kind
of
a
dick
there
was
just
someth
weird
abras
about
his
demeanor
cliff
robertson’
rest
in
peac
uncl
ben
was
vast
superior
to
sheen’
in
basic
everi
way
joey
johnson
realli
good
articl
except
you
start
the
problem
with
spiderman
4
when
everyon
know
it
was
spiderman
3
by
a
longshot
…also
i
would
argu
that
cast
tobey
macguir
was
a
huge
mistak
and
kirsten
dunst
was
unforgiv
marvel
has
yet
to
make
even
a
small
mistak
cast
where
as
soni
has
been
clueless
from
the
start
asid
from
molina
jk
simmon
and
mayb
garfield
stone
but
the
aw
write
never
gave
us
a
chanc
to
see
for
sure
frank
doomrid
johansen
i
prefer
andrew
garfield
over
tobi
becaus
he
was
more
cocki
and
had
more
confid
i
like
my
hero
to
be
confid
and
not
have
teen
angst
issu
i
haven’t
read
much
of
the
comic
but
i
have
watch
some
of
the
90’s
anim
which
is
where
most
of
my
knowledg
of
spider
man
come
from
when
i
watch
the
andrew
spidey
he
was
much
more
like
what
i
want
especi
when
he
was
spiderman
with
his
quick
comment
like
the
scene
in
the
car
with
with
ben’
killer
that
was
great
d
basic
the
way
andrew
talk
as
spidey
was
perfect
and
as
peter
he
was
great
as
well
i
never
like
the
fumbl
angst
attack
silent
parker
megagearmax
yep
no
way
that
nerdi
tobey
kid
could
actual
be
spider
man
sarcasm
asid
part
of
a
secret
ident
is
the
disguis
aspect
peter
parker
daili
bugl
photog
and
colleg
student
isn’t
the
daredevil
that
spider
man
is
frank
doomrid
johansen
i
haven’t
thought
much
about
who
will
play
spiderman
but
i
am
not
a
fan
of
gope
back
to
school
i
like
the
90’s
spider
man
anim
seri
not
the
kiddish
“ultimate”
one
or
whatev
i
like
spiderman
in
the
set
of
the
game
“web
of
shadows”
but
i
would
prefer
a
more
matur
and
experienc
spiderman
take
on
high
stake
battl
frank
doomrid
johansen
the
ultim
spider
man
cartoon
is
what
i
call
a
screwup
feel
more
like
spider
boy
lol
walt
kovac
spidey
as
a
dick
couldv
work
if
they
had
gone
with
the
ditko
parker
who
at
time
could
be
nasti
while
pretend
to
be
meek
and
mild…
but
this
would
take
an
actual
charact
arc
which
amaz
didnt
have
walt
kovac
but
oversea
gross
dont
count
as
much
as
domest
and
domest
flat
lined…
with
realli
bad
word
of
mouth
red
vector
i’m
piss
they’r
shift
capt
marvel
black
panther
and
inhuman
off
thier
releas
date
to
shoehorn
spider
man
into
the
mcu
what
if
spider
man
still
under
perform
even
with
marvel’
product
advic
help
what
if
soni
decid
to
get
uppiti
and
say
that
they
don’t
have
to
take
marvel’
advic
a
want
to
go
thier
own
way
after
all
hope
conting
were
built
into
this
deal
to
cover
these
potenti
problem
walt
kovac
realli
that
whi
spidey
2
was
a
huge
critic
success
and
amaz
1
was
not
walt
kovac
but
that
not
spiderman
you
didnt
want
spiderman
so
your
opinion
mean
jack
walt
kovac
if
the
ultim
version
of
parker
is
so
good
whi
did
they
kill
him
off
travi
you
haven’t
read
mani
spider
man
comic
have
you
spider
man
is
a
bulli
he
run
around
town
look
for
a
reason
to
beat
up
peopl
that
are
much
weaker
than
him
stan
himself
wrote
that
this
is
how
peter
parker
get
his
kick
travi
maguir
was
terribl
at
both
garfield
was
the
better
peter
and
spidey
frank
doomrid
johansen
if
you
are
gon
na
pull
that
sort
of
comment
then
i
say
that
the
onli
and
onli
real
spider
man
is
the
first
one
in
the
comic
and
no
reboot
whatsoev
after
that
in
ani
form
is
spiderman
walt
kovac
the
problem
start
with
3
and
that
is
what
made
raimi
walk
away
from
do
4
frank
doomrid
johansen
when
peter
becom
spider
man
he
get
confid
and
if
that
confid
doesn’t
blend
over
into
peter
parker
then
that
would
be
fuck
up
not
that
garfield
didn’t
have
ani
confid
befor
becom
spider
man
but
the
point
is
that
confid
should
not
be
someth
to
hide
like
a
superhero
trait
lol
what
i
have
alway
like
is
that
the
spider
power
chang
everyth
in
peter’
life
and
chang
him
i
don’t
want
him
to
be
like
clark
kent
in
the
80’s
movi
lol
nephtali
just
maisonet
i
am
spiderman
for
year
i
think
that
where
the
amaz
spider
man
film
failur
was
in
it
support
cast
what
mean
that
miss
what
peter
parker
peter
parker
and
that
is
troubl
he
has
in
daili
bugl
and
school
and
all
the
disappoint
he
has
balanc
act
life
as
peter
parker
and
spiderman
and
sam
raimi
succeed
he
captur
what
meant
to
be
spiderman
and
made
such
a
great
hero
and
was
not
that
swung
by
and
save
day
but
that
despit
all
the
headach
critic
and
troubl
he
went
through
he
alway
manag
to
do
the
right
thing
and
live
up
to
his
respons
that
he
promis
his
uncl
he
was
go
live
to
so
think
andrew
garfield
was
a
great
spiderman
and
so
was
emma
stone
as
gwen
and
rest
actor
great
action
was
great
the
two
movi
were
great
but
with
out
the
parker
luck
and
power
respons
ingredi
the
movi
stori
is
go
feel
lost
jay
keat
great
take
howev
garfield’
portray
particular
his
accent
in
asm2
was
terribl
peter
lack
the
angst
that
spider
man
momentarili
wipe
away
webb
should
have
focus
more
on
his
romant
strength
“500
days…”
rather
than
effect
and
convolut
villain
plot
thread
jay
keat
it’
ridicul
it
is
“ultimate”
in
name
onli
“amaz
friends”
held
the
tone
so
much
better
jay
keat
like
total
for
sure
hypestyl
amaz
2
had
too
mani
villain
and
gwen
didn’t
have
to
die
those
were
my
dealbreak
jonathan
snyder
you
are
not
alon
the
amaz
spider
man
is
my
favorit
spider
man
film
to
date
frank
doomrid
johansen
play
the
amaz
spider
man
2
on
ps3
ps4
avi
i
think
amaz
wasn’t
a
success
becaus
of
two
thing
1
origin
retel
–
a
sin
everyway
2
no
proper
develop
for
dr
connor
where
was
his
famili
otherwis
it
was
veri
good
if
someon
is
tri
to
equat
am
staci
with
his
comic
book
counterpart
that
person
has
never
read
comic
becaus
the
develop
upto
that
point
were
veri
differ
and
yes
the
green
goblin
power
ranger
movi
is
veri
bad
in
hindsight
but
spectacular
at
it’
time
but
molina’
ock
is
a
great
perform
i
think
onli
spidey
2
got
the
villain
right
none
of
the
els
have
come
close
though
i
did
wish
dane
dehaan
got
an
entir
film
to
himself
avi
i
think
you’r
mix
up
spidey
and
supe
a
fumbl
alter
ego
was
the
clark
kent
of
the
bryne
era
peter
hasn’t
been
that
person
sinc
long
ago
–
and
updat
him
to
more
confid
especi
consid
his
veri
popular
ultim
counterpart
was
such
is
not
a
sin
let
go
of
the
past
man
avi
explain
whi
make
sandman
the
killer
made
sens
in
the
origin
trilog
still
by
not
captur
ben’
killer
peter’
failur
is
evid
–
he
should
have
prevent
the
murder
not
play
hero
after
it
it’
in
line
with
bruce’
pursuit
of
joe
chill
in
some
iter
where
he
never
caught
him
ofcours
there
is
that
thing
that
the
murder
may
be
black
cat’
father…
but
who
know
now
where
they
intend
to
go
avi
i
hope
you
read
the
dreck
call
ultimatum
numer
popular
charact
like
wolverin
and
co
were
kill
for
shock
valu
peter
actual
got
a
dignifi
send
off
battl
the
goblin
we’v
seen
peter
die
numer
time
in
the
main
titl
the
other
die
wish
but
becaus
of
status
quo
he
had
to
return
in
the
main
univers
while
bendi
could
introduc
mile
who’
a
good
charact
on
his
own
appar
peter
is
back
with
the
ultim
line
fail
now
some
say
it
start
fail
the
day
peter
was
kill
off
–
that’
how
popular
that
charact
was
avi
yeah
but
peter
chose
not
to
kill
him
–
he
die
by
his
own
hand
and
it’
never
been
about
reveng
for
peter
it’
shouldn’t
be
hero
should
be
more
i
think
it’
also
tragic
that
peter
lost
gwen
after
staci
told
him
to
stay
away
from
her
–
becaus
even
love
isn’t
enough
sometim
i
think
this
show
a
transit
as
it
did
in
the
comic
–
asm
made
him
realiz
the
tragedi
of
not
act
as
a
hero
asm2
show
him
the
tragedi
of
act
as
one
both
have
a
price
and
love
sometim
isn’t
enough
i’m
sure
asm3
by
introduc
mari
jane
would
have
shown
love
can
win
over
thus
complet
the
trilog
flassh81
i
like
andrew
garfield
person
enjoy
his
perform
more
then
tobey
flassh81
i
also
never
bought

what
is
wrong
with
marvel
nowaday
killer
thought
the
1st
am
movi
was
great
a
helluva
lot
better
than
sam
raimi’
1st
3rd
spidey
flick
hater
are
gon
na
hate
the
dagman
we
definit
don’t
need
anoth
origin
movi
now
that
marvel
is
take
over
to
intro
the
charact
it
should
be
done
someth
like
how
quicksilv
and
the
scarlet
witch
were
introduc
at
the
end
of
the
winter
soldier
just
use
an
after
credit
tag
on
scene
focus
on
the
spider
at
the
scienc
demo
as
it
descend
on
it
web
as
you
hear
the
present
go
on
in
the
room
show
it
get
irradi
and
then
jump
onto
the
back
of
you
know
who
’s
hand
and
bite
it
hear
you
know
who
say
“ow
”
as
their
other
hand
slap
the
spider
dead
fade
to
black
with
the
slap
that’
all
you
need
you
don’t
even
need
to
cast
peter
parker
to
film
it
just
use
a
bodi
doubl
and
we
never
see
his
face
they
could
quick
film
this
littl
scene
and
tag
it
onto
either
age
of
ultron
or
ant
man
thus
establish
his
exist
prior
to
civil
war
will
ceyroll
the
problem
with
raimi’
spiderman
2
is
that
it
hit
too
mani
of
the
same
exact

has
that

have
an
experi
go
wrong
caus
him
to
get

find
out

and
end
up
die
which
movi
has
a
powerless
peter
gain
his
power
and
have
a
scene
where
he
test
them
out
in
exact
the

way
which

yes
both
and
mani
other
scene
and
plotpoint
not
onli
did
i
hate
spiderman

for
that
reason
but
it
made
the
first
one
which
i
like
at
that
point
kind
of
unwatch
for
me
afterward
then
the
third
one
was
just
plain
bad
tomchri

fine
i

i’m
go
to
put
the
blame
for
all
of
it
squar
on
raimi
whether
it
belong
there
or
not
becaus
it’
the
internet
and
i
can
do
that
it
was
pretti
clear
from
spider
man

that
everyon
involv
had
becom
far
too
big
for
their
britch
and
servic
ego
rather
than
charact
i
can
imagin
spider

with
even
more
sob
tobi
more
music
number
and
look
more
like
a
joel
schumach
batman
film
rather
than
a
spider

comic
i
credit
raimi
for
give
us
the
first
real
great
film
spider
man
but
i
also
credit
him
with
drive
it
into
the
ground
with
his
silli
nonsens
veronica

becaus
it
is
aw
too
angst
for

tri
too
hard
be

veronica

garfield
have

noth

he

i

you’r
suppos
to
look

the

instead
of
look
at
the
previous
step
brian
first
of
all
i
think
we
all
need
to
get
past
the
idea
that
the
amaz
spider
man
wasn’t
success
the
two
movi
made
close
to
a
billion
dollar
that’
a
lot
of
million
it
wasn’t
that
far
from
match
the
success
of
captain
america
which
we
would
probabl
all
agre
was
a
success
that
said
it
had
a
few
problem
i
don’t
agre
that
peter
parker
came
away
as
arrog
i
still
felt
like
he
was
insecur
garfield
just
show
a
differ
way
that
peopl
mask
insecur
i
do
think
that
in
the
spider
man
costum
he
came
away
a
littl
cocki
but
i
think
spider
man’
humor
can
come
across
that
way
sometim
i
thought
this
version
was
success
becaus
it
show
spider
man
as
someon
who
joke
a
lot
which
maguire’
never
did
it
also
show
the
intellect
of
garfield
as
he
fiddl
with
his
web
shooter
throughout
the
seri
i
thought
there
were
too
mani
villain
in
the
sequel
but
if
they
had
just
held
off
on
green
goblin
that
would
have
fix
it
i
love
gwen
staci
there
was
a
lot
done
well
in
asm
and
not
a
lot
done
poor
i
am
sad
to
see
garfield
go
but
i
also
have
a
lot
of
faith
in

mistmast
spider

he
was

the

peter
was
not
such
a

fraidi

like
tobey
portray
him
he
was
a
huge
scienc

sure
but
was
more

i
was

garfield’
overal
perform

his

too
it
was
a

i
don’t

the

was

drastic
chang
he
still
seem
to

with

but
just
someon
who
resembl
him
rememb
there
was
no
star
tattoo
on
his

then
your
skill
of
observ
render
your

observ
about
the
charact
moot
so
you’v
alreadi
proven
your
poor
observ
skill
that
asid
the
’90s
cartoon
spider
man
was
well
into
colleg
if
not
done
with
colleg
that
is
a
veri
differ
peter
than
the
awkward
bookish
outcast
he
was
in
high
school
even
after
he
found
his
self
confid
in
high
school
he
kept
it
hidden
under
the
veneer
of
the
awkward
nerd
so
as
to
not
bring
ani
suspicion
to
his
dual
ident
those
that
say
a
cocki
arrog
peter
was
just
an
updat
don’t
seem
to
understand
the
under
reason
for
the
charact
behav
differ
in
and
out
of
the
spidey
costum
especi
as
a
high
school
kid
eric
holm
proper
use
of
his
nerd
brain
he
had
to
look
up
the
basic
principl
of
electr
on
youtub
in
the
second
movi
if
he
made
his
web
shooter
in
the
first
movi
he
should
have
damn
well
understood
the
basic
principl
of
electr
without
have
to
look
them
up
they
were
all
over
the
place
in
that
aspect
in
the
first
he
was
a
prodigi
and
in
the
second
he’
sudden
not
awar
of
the
inform
requir
for
him
to
do
do
what
he
did
in
the
first
that’
just
realli
poor
inconsist
write
eric
holm
yes
he
doe
becom
more
confid
he
hide
that
as
peter
so
as
not
to
draw
undu
attent
and
suspicion
to
his
alter
ego
of
spider
man
it
wouldn’t
take
3
4
hour
to
convey
that
premis
just
writer
who
are
abl
to
write
more
than
a
few
scene
in
a
row
without
tire
clich
or
glare
inconsist
the
writer
kill
this
movi
i
pile
a
lot
of
the
blame
on
robert
orci
the
same
writer
respons
for
the
debacl
that
is
the
transform
franchis
eric
holm
the
amaz
spider
man
script
both
the
dialogu
and
plot
charact
develop
were
what
kill
this
franchis
inconsist
with
the
establish
charact
from
the
sourc
material…hel
even
the
inconsist
within
the
storylin
itself
were
glare
obvious
to
anyon
who
wasn’t
distract
by
the
“oooo
shini
”
as
for
peter
still
act
the
awkward
clumsi
outcast
that
fit
with
what
peter
was
like
at
that
age
in
the
comic
it’
the
reboot
which
got
the
charact
wrong
if
you
go
around
act
like
spider
man
out
of
the
costum
it
won’t
take
a
genius
to
put
two
and
two
togeth
that’
someth
that
was
a
cornerston
of
peter
in
the
comic
impli
in
raimi’
film
and
complet
abandon
and
ignor
in
webb’
frank
doomrid
johansen
i
should
have
said
“ben’
killer”
by
bad
i
was
write
fast
so
that
was
a
littl
laps
in
my
memori
as
i
wrote
it
good
of
you
to
point
it
out
they
deal
with
the
killer
in
the
amaz
spider
man
2
game
anyway
i
prefer
the
more
grown
up
parker
of
the
90’s
cartoon
over
the
teen
kid
i
know
they
are
both
the
same
and
not
2
differ
charact
lol
in
the
cartoon
he
has
a
job
at
the
daili
bugl
and
in
one
episod
he
work
for
fisk
even
if
it
is
to
set
parker
up
basic
i
prefer
him
more
grown
up
instead
of
be
a
kid
justin
davi
ive
said
this
over
and
over
most
spidey
fan
werent
even
aliv
when
spidey
was
an
awkward
nerd
after
he
becom
spider
man
he
start
gain
confid
pretti
quick
and
by
the
time
he
was
in
colleg
he
was
score
super
model
qualiti
women
and
the
onli
awkward
peopl
in
this
world
who
score
super
model
like
mari
jane
are
rich
which
we
all
know
peter
isnt
anyway
i
love
the
rami
trilog
back
when
it
came
out
i
even
like
the
3rd
one
but
onli
becaus
sandman
was
almost
as
perfect
as
doc
oc
was
in
the
second
but
i
think
the
amaz
movi
were
a
step
up
even
with
the
bad
script
plus
i
hate
toby’
stupid
face…
but
that
just
my
opinion
so
pleas
dont
yell
and
scream
and
post
a
bunch
of
comment
tri
to
argu
with
me
or
chang
my
mind
becaus
it
wont
phoenixprim
not
entir
true
gwen
die
at
the
hand
of
the
goblin
in
the
comic
as
well
michael
pont
spider
man
is
on
one
of
the
best
run
in
decad
it
is
the
decad
befor
the
90’s
where
there
was
troubl
much
of
that
has
even
been
redeem
in
the
last
year
from
brand
new
day
to
spider
vers
marvel
comic
has
been
write
some
amaz
stuff
particular
after
dan
slott
got
involv
michael
pont
i
debat
how
much
franchis
fatigu
will
effect
the
mcu
cowboy
movi
were
made
for
the
better
part
of
50
year
befor
they
taper
off
spi
movi
were
everywher
until
onli
bond
remain
i
think
the
mcu
has
a
shot
of
be
the
“bond”
of
comic
seri
but
that
comic
wave
is
far
from
over
we’v
got
a
solid
decad
of
more
domin
befor
i’d
get
too
worri
tomchri
sinc
marc
webb’
“amaz
spider
man”
film
are
a
thing
of
the
past
i
respect
your
critic
they
clear
were
not
the
“slam
dunks”
that
would
have
warrant
a
reboot
but
i
still
think
andrew
garfield’
peter
parker
spider
man
was
closer
in
spirit
to
the
comic
even
spider
man’
creator
stan
lee
has
said
so
on
mani
occas
get
back
to
tobi
you’ll
rememb
a
scene
in
the
best
spider
man
movi
to
date
“spider
man
2
”
when
peter
parker
use
his
spider
man
power
to
help
him
deliv
pizza
it’
a
hilari
moment
that
show
a
desper
kid
tri
to
manag
and
fail
this
whole
“superhero
thing
”
it’
also
a
perfect
illustr
when
sometim
peter’
all
too
real
world
would
mesh
with
spider
man’
sam
raimi
has
alway
admit
his
prefer
for
the
earli
stan
lee
steve
dikto
stori
the
first
two
film
reflect
that
but
i
will
hold
firm
that
a
superhero
who
had
been
to
hell
and
back
plus
won
the
girlfriend
of
his
dream
should
have
display
a
littl
growth
like
buy

same
as
alway
tobi
look
noth
like
peter
parker

while
you’r
ahead
smh
same
as
alway
lol
no
same
as
alway
bitch
you
think
your
mom

a

becaus
salli
was
be
a
mom
not
a

i
bet
you

bad
littl
brat
back

lol
same
as
alway
no
the
movi
did
not
get
it
right
doc
ock
was
an
ass
befor
the
tentacl
chris
taylor
she
may
have
been
play
a
mom
but
she
was
suppos
to
be
play
aunt
may
your
ad
hominem
point
lead
me
to
believ
you’r
not
into
comic
books…that’
the
discuss
here
not
myself
nor
my
famili
same
as
alway
i
read
plenti
of
comic
trust
me
i
know
who
aunt
may
is
as
well
as
you
should
know
that
she
doe
act
as
his
mom
becaus
peter’
real
mom
isn’t
there
yet
she
is
a
bitch
for
it
don’t
think
so
my
apolog
for
say
anyth
about

i
do
hope

where
i’m
come
from
now
chris
taylor
folk
on
this
thread
have
let
me
know
that
sally’
aunt
may
was
more
like
the
ultimate’
version
i
don’t
read
ultim
so
that
justifi
the
differ
in
my
mind
my
knowledg
of
spider
man
the
charact
in
his
titl
is
limit
to
those
run
from
the
late
70’s
to
the
earli
90’s
i’v
onli
recent
gotten
back
into
collect
in
the
last
3
or
4
year
as
i
lost
my
1st
collect
in
a
divorc
was
a
bit
nauseous
about
that
for
a
while
for
me
rosemari
harris’
aunt
may
was
pretti
spot
on
but
i’m
of
the
opinion
that
more
of
the
charact
in
the
spider
man
trilog
were
closer
to
what
i’m
familiar
with
than
the
charact
in
the
amaz
spider
man
movi
there
were
poor
portray
in
the
trilog
for
sure
but
it
was
closer
to
the
comic
i’m
familiar
with
alan
pedro
siddaway
tthe
first
spiderman
film
where
crap
the
amaz
spiderman
film
are
100
better
they
should
keep
the
current
spiderman
for
the
new
film
alan
pedro
siddaway
and
any1
that
think
tobi
is
the
better
spiderman
love
cheesi
horribl
bullshit
and
need
2
go
back
to
watch
glee
lozpot
the
amaz
spiderman
comic
book

a
pretti
good
job
of
screw
thing

too
–
the
spider
vers
saga

all
but
put
me

the

ultim
spiderman

the
place
