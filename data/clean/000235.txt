unlik
a
lot
of
peopl
i
was
a
big
fan
of
the
first
amaz
spider
man
movi
i
like
garfield
practic
idol
emma
stone
after
easi
a
and
their
chemistri
was
leap
ahead
of
whatev
spidey
and
mjs
chemistri
was
even
though
i
like
the
movi
i
was
still
tire
of
see
the
same
stori
again
after
grow
up
with
the
tobi
maguir
movi
i
still
get
secondhand
embarrass
think
about
the
third
one
so
know
that
marvel
has
spidey
back
is
great
but
i
canâ€™t
have
a
third
origin
stori
about
the
same
charact
i
want
spidey
in
small
dose
like
in
cap
3
and
aveng
3
pt
1
and
2
but
i
donâ€™t
think
anoth
seri
of
spiderman
movi
is
necessari
deema
ps
i
still
wan
na
see
the
scene
of
shailen
woodley
as
mj
that
were
alreadi
film
tho
â€œshailen
woodley
play
mari
jane
is
my
new
person
â€œsecond
half
of
theâ
magnific
amberson
what
a
tantal
cinemat
â€œwhat
if
what
a
fascin
counter
histor
blind
alley
by
all
account
woodleyâ€™
role
inâ
amaz
2â
was
alway
go
to
be
a
short
oneâ€”itâ€™
possibl
that
she
was
onli
â€œplay
mari
jane
the
way
felic
jone
was
â€œplay
black
cat
by
which
i
mean
there
was
mayb
one
scene
where
spider
man
did
someth
and
then
shailen
woodley
appear
with
red
hair
and
then
someon
offscreen
said
â€œhey
mj
letâ€™
go
hang
out
somewher
offscreen
untilâ
amaz
3
the
absenc
of
woodley
from
the
finish
product
is
fascin
main
becaus
itâ€™
difficult
to
imagin
ani
clear
cut
logic
reason
whi
she
wouldâ€™v
been
cut
on
a
pure
commerci
level
woodley
in
may
2014
was
come
offâ
divergentâ
and
was
deep
into
theâ
fault
in
our
starsâ
media
blitz
pre
victori
tour
on
a
pure
narrat
level
itâ€™
hard
to
imagin
howâ
amaz
spider
man
2â
couldâ€™v
been
anyâ
moreâ
of
a
jumbleâ€”whatâ€™sâ
one
more
brief
appear
by
a
high
market
young
superstar
more
import
the
lack
of
woodley
in
amaz
2â
meant
theâ
amazingâ
franchis
couldnâ€™t
contribut
to
the
excel
histori
of
unconvinc

in

movi
look
at
you
red

dunst
red

janssen
red

johansson
and
red

paltrow
i
hope
some
differ
spider
villain
can
be
introduc
to
the
soni
marvel
film
â
i
realli
am
uninterest
in
see
yet
anoth
goblin
and
alfr
molina
alreadi
gave
us
a
top
notch
dr
octopus
â
the
moral
hollow
of
venom
leav
me
cold
and
so
i
realli
hope
he
doesnâ€™t
get
a
spinoff
film
â
how
about
some
ditko
romita
era
villain
like
mysterio
kraven
and
the
vultur
â
also
spider
man
has
never
had
to
deal
with
the
mob
in
ani
of
his
film
despit
organ
crime
be
a
regular
featur
of
the
comic
â
the
kingpin
was
long
ago
draft
by
the
daredevil
comic
and
the
current
netflix
show
but
what
about
folk
like
silverman
hammerhead
the
rose
and
tombston
last
i
vote
yes
on
the
introduct
of
black
cat
but
the
filmmak
are
go
to
figur
out
what
angl
to
go
with
if
the
next
spidey
is
still
a
high
school
teen
a
teen
black
cat
portray
would
need
to
tone
down
the
sexi
for
obvious
reason
â
a
matur
black
cat
would
inadvert
forc
a
â€˜cougarâ€™
angl
on
the
charact
pun
intend
â
i
actual
like
the
latter
idea
â
weâ€™ll
see
christoph
marvel
studio
has
been
intrigu
judici
about
overload
it
movi
with
too
much
comic
book
histori
the
kevin
feig
playbook
is
to
take
a
few
key
element
of
all
import
histori
and
throw
them
togeth
with
new
sometim
self
conscious
contemporari
affect
soâ
thorâ
just
got
rid
of
the
characterâ€™
entir
fascin
but
confus
histori
of
bodi
swap
alter

soâ
iron
manâ
pretend
war
machin
and

pott
had
alway
been
toni
starkâ€™
sitcom
bro
sitcom
will
they
wonâ€™t
they
love

it
will
be
interest
then
to
see
what
marvel
studio
doe
with
spider
man
a
charact
whose
histori
has
been
cover
mani
time
over
by
two
differ
movi
if
you
ask
me
the
mysterio
kraven
vultur
idea
is
smart
â
marvel
studio
like
to
promot
back
catalogu
villain
whiplash
frost
giant
and
do
a
fun
weird
retro
stori
about
an
angri
fli
man
or
a
crazi
hunter
would
immedi
giveâ
the
spectacular
spider
manâ
work
titl
of
2017
spinoff
a
new
vibe
and
so
would
bring
in
the
black
cat
the
onli
love
interest
whoâ€™
never
realli
appear
in
the
moviesâ€”and
more
import
a
charact
who
doesnâ€™t
necessarili
have
a
rich
comic
book
histori
to
ruin
felicia
hardi
could
be
a
fun
charact
a
thief
an
anti
hero
a
wild
card
who
stand
outsid
the
usual
good
evil
divid
mayb
hire
shailen
woodley
thank
for
your
eulog
for
the
amaz
spider
man
â
i
havenâ€™t
even
watch
these
two
film
main
for
the
reason
you
point
out
â
superhero
franchis
may
need
to
becom
more
like
classic
jame
bond
â
assum
everyon
know
the
protagonistâ€™
origin
or
ignor
it
complet
dive
into
a
self
contain
stori
with
action
with
littl
charact
develop
unfortun
â
such
film
could
featur
a
specif
â€œone
villain
and
support
charact
that
may
or
may
not
be
around
for
addit
stori
â
and
most
import
no
one
bat
an
eye
whenev
a
new
actor
step
in
to
fill
the
heroâ€™
tuxedo
tight
the
onli
other
option
is
to
featur
a
trilog
at
most
and
then
take
a
minimum
ten
year
hiatus
befor
return
to
the
charact
â
in
the
current
climat
howev
most
studio
wonâ€™t
be
so
patient
wait
for
a
rocket
reboot
dannyâ
agre
on
all
count
iâ€™m
go
to
call
this
the
jame
bond
paradigm
the
idea
that
franchis
need
to
stop
pretend
like
everi
new
movi
is
the
most
import
stori
ever
in
the
characterâ€™
histori
the
best
superhero
comic
book
arenâ€™t
issu
1â€”they
happen
later
when
the
hero
has
becom
the
storyâ€™
constant
and
the
creator
start
to
plug
him
her
into
differentâ
variabl
new
set
new
villain
new
job
and
if
you
think
that
jame
bond
movi
are
too
repetit
mayb
itâ€™d
be
even
better
to
follow
the
doctor
who
paradigm
everi
standalon
stori
is
told
in
a
radic
differ
way
featur
vast
differ
support
cast
and
mayb
even
a
differ
timelin
captain
america
the
winter
soldierâ
was
a
whole
lot
differ
from
the
firstâ
cap
convers
â
thor
the
dark
worldâ
was
practic
a
half
remak
of
the
firstâ
thor
what
weâ€™r
say
is
how
about
a
spider
man
movi
with
no
bridg
hi
mr
franich
â
i
recent
read
your
articl
â€œrip
the
amaz
spider
man
and
had
quit
a
few
thought
on
it
first
off
i
think
it
was
incred
well
written
as
most
of
your
piec
are
and
brought
up
a
lot
of
interest
discuss
point
still
i
did
find
myself
respect
disagre
with
a
lot
of
the
idea
you
present
i
found
your
review
to
be
a
sort
of
borderlin
offens
eulog
to
a
seri
that
deserv
more
person
i
think
amazingâ
was
much
much
better
than
the
tobi
maguir
seri
â
it
may
have
not
been
oscar
worthi
materi
but
it
was
fun
it
was
authent
and
honest
the
chemistri
between
garfield
and
stone
alon
was
enough
to
give
the
film
someth
that
the
other
seri
seem
to
lack
which
was
heart
and
chemistri
itâ€™
difficult
to
articul
but
i
feel
as
if
the
two
marc
webb
film
had
a
sort
of
comic
book
feel
to
them
devoid
of
the
cynic
and
contriv
dark
thatâ€™
so
often
the
mo
with
superhero
movi
today
â
from
the
palpabl
incompar
chemistri
between
andrew
and
emma
to
the
smart
wit
of
the
film
to
the
relat
nonexist
of
cynic
in
the
film
i
will
absolut
complet
mourn
the
death
of
such
a
fabul
seri
and
so
i
say
rip
the
amaz
spider
manâ
1
and
2
â€“
my
heart
will
forev
be
encas
in
it
web
â
best
â
kyle
kyle
is
veri
generious
voic
a
common
strain
argument
amongâ
amazingâ
partisan
the
idea
that
theâ
amazingâ
movi
were
success
more
than
anyth
as
romanc
with
genuin
emot
that
was
lack
in
the
goofier
sam
raimi
movi
my
problem
with
this
argument
is
the
deeper
layer
of
cynic
that
ran
throughout
bothâ
amazingâ
movi
i
guess
you
could
argu
that
they
invest
more
time
in
some
of
peterâ€™
emot
relationship
martin
sheenâ€™
uncl
ben
surviv
longer
than
cliff
robertsonâ€™
and
vast
span
of
two
movi
are
spent
stare
at
andrew
garfield
and
emma
stone
smile
at
each
other
while
mouth
sweet
noth
but
neither
movi
actual
tri
to
take
these
relationship
serious
â
amazingâ
1â
know
uncl
ben
is
go
to
die
and
know
you
know
it
and
so
the
characterâ€™
protact
exist
feel
shamelessâ€”th
equival
of
an
actor
stretch
a
death
scene
out
to
last
for
the
entir
second
act
the
weirdest
thing
to
me
is
how
mani
peopl
overr
peter
gwen
relationship
by
compar
it
negat
to
the
peter
mj
relationship
in
the
originalâ
spider
men
actual
itâ€™
becom
a
weird
shorthand
to
throw
shade
on
the
entir
orginalâ
spider
manâ
trilog
ridiculousâ€”especi
becaus
peter
and
mjâ€™s
relationship
is
so
much
more
complic
inâ
spider
man
2
peter
is
a
lone
man
becaus
he
refus
to
reveal
his
true
ident
to
mj
so
mj
get
engag
so
peter
decid
that
he
doesnâ€™t
want
to
be
spider
man
anymor
and
tell
mj
that
heâ€™
a
chang
manâ€”and
mj
is
understand
a
bit
confus
and
even
angri
sinc
peter
parker
is
a
good
friend
who
is
now
tell
her
â€œhey
engag
girl
love
me
compar
that
to
theâ
amazingâ
movi
where
gwen
basic
spend
two
movi
tell
peter
â€œi
love
you
and
peter
spend
two
movi
constant
say
â€œi

you
i
donâ€™t
want
to
be
with

i
want
you
your
father
told
me
to
leav
you
alon
i
love
you
leav
like
from
gwenâ€™
perspect
theâ
amazingâ
movi
are
basic
about
an
emot
abus
boyfriend
who
wonâ€™t
leav
you
alon
when
youâ€™r
broken
up
even
though
heâ€™
the
one
who
broke

and
donâ€™t
even
get
me
start
onâ
spider
man
3
which
is
not
a
good
movi
but
which
has
an
incred
arc
for
mari
jane
serious
watch
what
kirsten
dunst
get
to
play
inâ
spider
man
3â€”profession
frustrat
failur
desper
suspicion
that
the
man
she
love
has
becom
a
veri
differ
person
even
befor
an
alien
symbiot
give
him
bad
hairâ€”and
ask
yourself
how
mani
actress
in
superhero
movi
sinc
2007
have
gotten
even
half
that
final
someon
voic
what
i
have
thought
all
along
i
have
enjoy
spiderman
most
of
my
49
year
and
have
amass
quit
of
a
collect
â
with
the
first
movi
i
toler
the
cheesi
stori
and
crap
act
becaus
i
had
wait
my
entir
life
for
a
spidey
movi
and
the
special
effect
did
not
disappoint
howev
the
amaz
movi
were
well
letâ€™
just
say
you
nail
it
hope
in
the
next
movi
the
cast
for
spiderman
will
get
it
right
and
hope
he
will
at
least
not
be
british
great
stori
brian
guy
serious
though
â
spider
man
2â
is
realli
good
you
mention
the
decis
to
includ
the
wrinkl
about
peter
parkerâ€™
parent
be
spi
which
you
refer
to
as
a
â€œlater
addit
to
canon
this
plot
thread
was
introduc
to
spider
man
comic
in
1968
just
four
year
into
the
histori
of
the
charact
which
i
guess
is
still
but
the
way
you
convey
it
seem
a
tad
decept
to
me
yes
peter
parkerâ€™
parent
turn
out
to
be
spi
and
shield
agent
eventu
and
yesâ€¦thi
seem
like
a
bit
for
the
characterâ€¦
â€¦which
is
whi
the
amaz
movi
jettison
the
angl
and
instead
went
for
someth
a
littl
more
in
spider
manâ€™
littl
corner
of
the
univers
espionag
sabotag
and
abus
of
scienceâ€¦ther
is
noth
more
spider
man
than
that
in
regard
to
his
adversari
and
background
mayb
it
had
been
seen
befor
in
other
moviesâ€¦but
had
it
been
seen
befor
in
a
spider
man
movi
no
which
is
againâ€¦whi
they
went
in
that
direct
explor
peterâ€™
relationship
with
his
parent
and
in
juxtapositionâ€¦with
ben
and
may
was
a
new
angl
they
could
add
to
the
origin
stori
that
you
right
have
point
out
everyon
is
probabl
sick
of
by
now
if
these
movi
are
guilti
of
anyth
in
regard
to
this
angl
it
is
not
commit
to
it
more
rather
than
have
it
be
present
in
the
first
place
as
far
as
andrew
garfield
versus
tobey
mcguir
goesâ€¦i
will
just
say
thisâ€¦on
one
of
these
spider
men
consist
made
me
laughâ€¦and
it
wasnâ€™t
mr
seabiscuit
can
anyon
honest
quot
a
spider
man
one
liner
from
the
raimi
trilog
that
was
actual
clever
and
wasnâ€™t
a
total
groaner
so
garfieldâ€™
peter
parker
had
an
to
himâ€¦peopl
seem
to
act
like
this
is
out
of
charact
for
some
reason
peter
parker
was
never
the
puppi
eye
doughi
face
doormat
that
tobey
mcguir
portray
ditko
and
leeâ€™
peter
parker
was
a
passion
angri
young
man
who
stood
up
to
flash
jonah
and
anyon
els
that
gave
him
crap
he
wasnâ€™t
afraid
to
make
his
feel
toward
pretti
girl
known
be
they
liz
allan
betti
brant
gwen
staci
or
mari
jane
watson
he
alway
temper
himself
becaus
of
fragil
old
aunt
mayâ€¦but
salli
field
is
hard
that
same
old
ladi
who
took
heart
attack
everi
five
issu
is
she
i
think
andrew
garfield
was
a
far
more
faith
peter
parker
and
a
far
more
charact
to
root
for
and
follow
altogeth
iâ€™m
quit
sad
to
see
him
go
if
that
is
the
case
thank
for
the
opportun
to
express
my
thought
mike
mike
wrote
a
much
longer
email
which
includ
a
portion
defend
the
filmsâ€™
decis
to
go
darker
and
grittier
which
i
had
to
excis
becaus
i
promis
not
to
pick
on
christoph
nolan
this
week
i
agre
that
thereâ€™
noth
wrong
in
principl
with
bring
in
peterâ€™
parentsâ€¦except
that
the
movi
didnâ€™t
realli
bring
in
the
parent
they
just
kept
mention
them
over
and
over
again
in
the
process
they
manag
to
make
peter
evenâ
moreâ
of
an
orphan
his
parent
are
murder
uncl
ben
get
murder
yeesh
by
the
end
â
gwenâ
get
murder
i
guess
you
could
argu
that
this
make
the
movi
more
â€œreal
but
if
anyth
it
make
them
seem
even
more
cynic
peter
just
keep
on
bounc
back
from
these
loss
with
the
bare
minimum
of
screen
time
devot
to
him
briefli
mourn
the
film
never
quit
figur
out
how
to
tap
into
an
essenti
aspect
of
the
origin
spider
man
mythologyâ€”th
idea
that
peter
is
a
straightfac
nerdi
kid
with
the
soul
of
a
goofbal
hero
instead
the
film
basic
argu
that
peter
is
a
jame
dean
lookalik
who
put
on
a
mask
to
becom
a
comedian
at
open
mic
night
the
key
thing
that
i
would
disagre
on
with
mike
is
the
idea
that
tobey
maguir
was
a
the
idea
that
the
peter
of
the
classic
spidey
era
was
a
passion
firebird
both
are
true
to
a
certain
extent
but
whatâ
the
best
spideri
stori
get
atâ€”th
idea
that
motiv
all
ofâ
spider
man
2â€”is
the
idea
that
peterâ€™
life
kinda
just
suck
most
of
the
time
and
the
most
heroic
thing
he
doe
is
get
out
of
bed
everi
day
in
theâ
amazingâ
movi
peterâ€™
life
doesnâ€™t
suck
he
has
a
girlfriend
who
is
a
brilliant
generous
model
he
stand
up
to
the
bulli
at
school
and
the
bulli
wind
up
total
respect
him
â
the
movi
tilt
for
a
second
at
the
parkersâ€™
econom
realityâ€”aunt
mayâ
is
train
to
be
a
nurseâ€”but
compar
to
peterâ€™
cruddi
apart
in
the
originalâ

dear

thank
for
the
articl
you
wrote
about

â
you
made
some
good
point
after
read
it
i
had
question
aboutâ
â€œencroach
origin
fatigu
the
sens
that
peopl
might
final
be
get
fed
up
with
the
storyâ
beforeâ
the
stori
â
similarâ
comment
have
been
made
a
lot
late
specif
about
spider
man
yet
not
so
much
with
otherâ
major
charact
are
you
say
that
specif
about
spider
man
or
superhero
originsâ
inâ
moviesâ
and
comic
in
general
â
i
ask
as
a
comic
book
writer
also
write
aâ
screenplayâ
were
the
charactersâ€™â
origin
are
key
to
further
stori
â
should
i
and
other
writer
take
that
potentialâ
fatigu
as
aâ
warn
of
sort
to
ditch
origin
in
movi
andâ
comic
â
in
yourâ
opinionâ
is
it
best
to
just
jump
into
the
action
with
littl
or
no
explan
also
do
you
think
fan
preferâ
concis
simpl
origin
like
blade
chronicl
or
even
bond
in
casino
royal
and
do
you
thinkâ
origin
even
brief
one
add
much
neededâ
