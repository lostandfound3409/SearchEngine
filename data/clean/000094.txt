the

best
left
for

although
i

warn
you
that
the
actual
whodunit
part
isn

veri
suspens
as
mention
abov
the
real
point
of
this
be
a
murder
mysteri
is
for
eco
to
show
just
how
similar
human
behav
back
then
as
we
do
now
even

a

i
love
my

a
lot
more
the
devil
made
me
do
it
the
argument
for
it
be
a
classic
fan
of
this
novel
and
there
are
a
whole
lot
of
them
it
s
hard
to
dislik
this
book
frank
argu
that
this
book
deserv
the
classic
label
more
quick
than
a
lot
of
other
contemporari
novel
do
after
all
the
book
s
onli
27
year
old
at
this
point
precis
becaus
it
deal
with
issu
from
an
age
of
classic
so
in
other
word
becaus
it
s
set
in
mediev
time
is
written
in
dark
age
vernacular
and
includ
histor
detail
worthili
accur
of
the
respect
academ
eco
is
fan
claim
that
of
cours
the
name
of
the
rose
will
eventu
be
a
classic
such
a
foregon
conclus
that
we
might
as
well
declar
it
one
now
ah
but
there
s
also
a
much
stronger
argument
for
this
be
consid
a
classic
right
now
as
mention
mani
of
those
who
studi
the
esoter
academ
field
of
semiot
claim
that
the
novel
is
a
perfect
exampl
of
what
they
do
explain
in
layman
s
term
so
that
non
academ
can
final
get
it
as
such
then
these
peopl
claim
that
the
name
of
the
rose
is
not
just
an
excit
davinci
code
style
histor
thriller
but
also
a
dens
layer
examin
of
stori
about
stori
about
stori
of
symbol
about
symbol
about
symbol
of
the
mean
behind
mean
behind
mean
yeah
see
what
they
mean
when
they
say
that
semiot
is
a
hard
thing
to
explain
to
the
general
public
the
argument
against
the
main
argument
against
this
be
a
classic
seem
to
be
one
brought
up
a
lot
with
well
written
yet
contemporari
book
contemporari
in
this
case
be
ani
less
than
half
a
centuri
old
that
the
book
is
simpli
too
new
to
be
abl
to
reason
judg
whether
it
should
right
be
call
a
timeless
classic
one
of
those
fabl
book
you
should
read
befor
you
die
for
just
one
exampl
when
the
name
of
the
rose
first
came
out
in
1980
it
was
the
first
time
anyon
had
ever
tri
set
a
ration
holmesian
style
mysteri
stori
within
a
mediev
monasteri
in
the
year
sinc
we
ve
had
all
kind
of
project
on
the
subject
includ
a
popular

bbc
masterpiec
seri
it
s
a

even
it

are
quick
to
point
out
even
if
somewhat
on
the
dri
side
at
point
ugh
all
those
debat
about
papal
decre
but
who
s
to
say
if
anyon
s
go
to
even
rememb
this
novel
a
hundr
year
from
now
or
the
notori
spotti
career
eco
has
sinc
had
as
a
novelist
don
t
forget
eco
is
most
a
scholar
and
historian
although
consid
a
rockstar
in
the
academ
world
his
reput
as
a
writer
of
fiction
is
much
more
contenti
my
verdict
so
let
s
make
it
clear
right
off
the
bat
that
from
a
pure
entertain
standpoint
the
name
of
the
rose
is
one
of
the
most
delight
novel
i
ve
read
in
year
year
it
s
funni
it
s
smart
it
s
insight
it
s
thrill
it
s
nerdi
chees
and
rice
it
s
everyth
a
lover
of
book
could
possibl
ever
want
from
a
well
done
one
but
is
it
a
classic
well
unfortun
i
think
i
m
go
to
have
to
agre
with
the
critic
on
this
one
that
although
it
could
veri
well
becom
a
classic
one
day
one
of
those
catcher
in
the
rye
style
one
hit
wonder
that
popul
so
mani
list
i
think
it
s
simpli
too
earli
to
make
such
a
call
either
in
a
posit
or
negat
way
especi
consid
eco
s
otherwis
spotti
career
as
a
novelist
that
s
part
of
the
point
of
classic
list
exist
after
all
and
whi
those
who
care
about
such
list
take
them
so
serious
becaus
ultim
such
a
design
should
reflect
not
onli
how
good
a
book
itself
is
but
how
well
it
s
stood
the
test
of
time
of
how
relev
it
s
continu
to
be
to
generat
after
generat
of
how
timeless
the
author
s
style
and
word
choic
one
alway
has
to
be
care
when
ad
newish
book
to
such
list
especi

less

30

becaus
we
have
no

at

are
go
to
stand
the
test
of

load
up
your

even
of

out

award
it
s
for
this
reason
that
i

exclud
the

still
high
encourag
all
of
you
to

keep

close

his

what
fascin
me
the
most
was
how

and
give
the

a

howev
he
also
throw
in
the
loophol
that

may
not

ani
inher

and
that
it
is
senseless
to

to

this
could
present
quiet
a
dilemma
for
a
monk
who
s
life
draw
mean
from
the
gospel
perhap
the
most
excit
aspect
of
this
novel
was
that
it
was
a
book
about
book
the
whole
novel
spin
around
sever
text
such
as
aristotl
and
revel
but
is
made
up
of
other
book
he
even
draw
the
reader
attent
to
this
as
william
explain
to
adso
how
the
content
of
one
book
can
be
discern
by
read
other
book
he
string
togeth

also
to

of

this

is
satur
with
allus
to

there
is
even
a
blind

much
like
the
real
borg
name
jorg
of
burgo
i
would
high
recommend
pick
up
a
copi
of
his
collect

simpli
becaus
it
is
a
phenomen
read
and
to
read
select
stori
such
as
the
librari
of

simultan
with
the
name
of
the

as
eco
drew
much
of
his
inspir
for
this
book
from

stori
the
scene
in
the
labyrinthin
librari
of
the

are
gold
i
want
to
get
lost
with
william
and
adso
as
they
flip
through
great
work
togeth
while
tri
to
make
sens
of
their
obfusc
surround
eco
s
use
of
metafict
great
add
to
this
novel
as
an
acut
read
will
show
eco
is
often
talk
more
about
the
book
itself
than
the
actual
plot
with
his
two

he
also
leav
in
plenti
of
untransl

while
have
william
conclud
that
true
scholar
must
first
master

and
to
key
in
on
the

that
this

was
a

found

he
leav
some
detect
work
for
the

i
thank
him
for
that
you

are
scant

would
not

with

what
some

these
are

more
than
a

recognis
most
of

anyway
they
are
quot
from

so
on

usual
famous

non

will
usual
get
the
essenc

from

in
almost
all
case
they
are
rough
translat

paraphras
in

so
they
aren

while

it
twist

it
is
not
alway
possibl
to

up
with
an
answer
that
leav
no
ambigu
there
is
more
than
one
labyrinth
present
in
eco
s
wonder
work
one
question
relat
to
the
interpret
of

itself
is
knowledg
finit
are
there
univers
truth
or
is
it
a

of
what
appear
to
be
the
truth
onli
subject
to
interpret
by
individu
to
the
librarian
of
the
abbey
melko
knowledg
was
someth
to
be
protect
from
disclosur
as
i
mention
to
one
friend
the
librari
took
on
the
connot
of
eden
s
tree
of
life
from
which
man
and
woman
were
forbidden
to
eat
it
was
knowledg
gain
from
eat
the
forbidden
fruit
that
led
to
the
loss
of
innoc
consid
that
the
librari
contain
mani
work
consid
by
the
librarian
to
be
the
work
of
infidel
it
would
be
their
purpos
to
hide
those
work
from
the
innoc
yet
the
mere
possess

also
led
to
it
misinterpret

the

the

it
will
be

until

human

now
i
realiz
that
not
infrequ
book
speak
of
book
it
is
as
if
they
spoke
among
themselv
in
the
light
of
this
reflect
the
librari
seem
all
the
more
disturb
to
me
it
was
then
the
place
of
long
centuri
old
murmur
an
impercept
dialogu
between
one
parchment
and
anoth
a
live
thing
a
receptacl
of
power
not

by
a
human

a

eman
by

mind
surviv
the
death
of
those
who
had
produc
them
or
had
been
their
conveyor
even
william
was
subject
to
hear
word
so
familiar
he
knew
he
had
read
them
befor
but
could
not
rememb
the
name
of
the
book
â€œit
seem
to
me
as
i
read
this
page
that
i
had
read
some
of
these
word
befor
and
some
phrase
that
are
almost
the
same
which
i
have
seen
elsewher
return
to
my
mind
book
find
themselv
the
creator
of
other
book
when
they
becom
so
deepli
plant
in

nabokov
s
charact
first
appear
in
a
short
stori
lolita
written
in
1916
by
heinz
von

the
stori
line
are
quit
similar
nabokov
has
been
said
to
have
creat
artist
improprieti
or
been
subject

a
phenomenon
known
as
cryptomnesia
a

of

stori
he
had
onc
read
michael

wrote

has
alway
been
a
huge
crucibl
in

familiar

are
continu
recast
perhap
jame
baldwin
said
it
best
it
was
book
that
taught
me
that
the
thing
that
torment
me
most
were
the
veri
thing
that
connect
me
with
all
the
peopl
who
were
aliv
or
who
had
ever
been
aliv
as
the
name
of
the
rose
contain
a
multitud
of
latin
phrase
i
think
it
fit
to
add
one
more
not
includ
in
the
book
itself
that
is
sub
rosa
the
concept
first
appear
in
egyptian
cultur
the
rose
was
the
symbol
of
the
egyptian
god
horus
most
often
repres
by
a
child
hold
his
finger
to
his
mouth
as
if
he
were

shhhh
it
becam
symbol
of

it
reappear
in

mytholog
venus
aphrodit
gave

insid
a

the

taken
from

and
so
the
stori
proceed
with
layer
of
refer
to
surpris

amus
howev
if
you
are
in
danger
of
flounder
among

the
trick
is
to
find
out
what
the
hidden
book
at
the
centr
of
the

is
all
about
and
to
keep
that
in
mind
for
everi
reread
the
relationship
between
truth
myth
and
invent
is
a
theme
that
in
the
name
of
the

share
with
foucault
pendulum
and
baudolino
here
we
are
introduc
to
the

room
and
it
hidden

which
we
can
take
as
a
metaphor
for
the
mean
of

or
the
quest
for

in

mayb
but
with
intellig

the

can
know

in

by

the

given
the

no

the
middl

were
a

continu
a
long
tradit
of
dogmat
asshatteri
follow
the
gourd
follow
the
sandal
is
just
silli
while
all
the
semiot
stuff
whizz
right
over
my
head
i
was
still
glu
to
the
page
and
didn
t
skip
a
word
and
it
didn
t
feel
like
a
chore
pat
self
on
back
cool
the
last
part
of
the
book
was
slight
differ
than
the
movi
even
so
the
fact
that
the
mysteri
plot
itself
adher
close
to
the
book
didn
t
make
it
bore
or
a
feel
of
arrgh
i
ve
seen
this
alreadi
on
the
contrari
there
was
so
much
new
stuff
with
the
histori
and
theolog
that
the
whole
thing
was
super
fresh
and
excit
the
humor
i
love
adso
s
narrat
and
the
come
of
age
aspect
of
it
as
well
as
his
older
self
look
back
on
his
younger
self
perspect
he
and
william
had
a
great
rapport
anoth
thing
that
the
movi
nail
that
abbey
was
one
gay
place
as
is
obvious
i
d
seen
the
movi
befor
read
the
book
and
i
think
it
made
the
read
experi
a
bit
easier
so
i
could
focus
on
the
theolog
debat
the
histori
and
eco
s
narrat
style
i
d
recommend
see
the
movi
first
especi
if
you
re
approach
the
book
as
a
random
read
and
not
as
a
literari
scholar
which
i
ain
t
as
is
obvious
i
great
enjoy
it
and
am
glad
that
i
final

read
it

understand

go

but
just
tri
to
tell
someon
els
what
s
go
on
and
what

be

pffft
forget
it
read
it

yourself
that

it
illustr
my
point
the
overwhelm
power
of

and
subsequ
deduct
the

think

heighten
these

that
headi
mix
of
moral
antagon

was
veri

it
s
a

that
it
didn

the

william

has
slip

saw
the

of
write
down
what

and
his
discomfort

that

that

what

is
that

stretch
mean
from

i
come
to
my
own
conclus
base
on
what
i
have
read
and
learn
in
the
past
as
william
solv
his
case
the
wrong
way
but
with
the
right
answer
i
don
t
read
latin
as
adso
doesn
t
read
greek
as
william
doesn
t
read
arab
as
mortal
man
can
never
read
god
s
languag
and
so
we
make
our
own
assumpt
base
on
what
we
do
know
the
world
s
knowledg
is
constant
fragment
and
we
keep
what
we
can
use
we
forget
or
reinvent
one
day
the
librari
will
burn
the
databas
will
fail
and
the
onli
book
that
will
matter
are
the
one
we
ve
read
and
who
can
read
what
book
here
i
begin
my
ode
to
the
joy
of
read
two
book
simultaneouslyi
pick
up
this
book
read
with
oprah
the
book
club
that
chang
america
not
becaus
i
am
necessarili
interest
in
the
particular
book
that
compris
oprah
s
list
but
becaus
the
phenomenon
as
a
booksel
intrigu
me
my
own
attitud
as
book
snob
was
out
when
cormac
mccarthi
join
her
rank
and
i
felt
the
mass
public
didn
t
deserv
his
offer
you
have
to
earn
an
appreci
for
mccarthi
what
the
hell
do
i
mean
by
that
here
watch
me
struggl
with
my
conscienc
if
you
tell
me
your
favorit
author
is
picoult
my
recommend
will
never
be
mccarthi
even
though
i
feel
he
ll
alway
be
a
more
satisfi
read
but
you
re
not
readi
you
don
t
want
to
reorgan
the
furnitur
in
your
head
you
just
want
a
touch
of
color
on
your
sofa
and
that
s
ok
move
furnitur
is
a
lot
of
hard
work
and
i
like
an
easi
read
between
move
but
my
favorit
reason
to
read
is
to
chang
that
s
not
everyon
s
reason
what
doe
this
have
to
do
with
name
of
the
rose
you
ask
becaus
there
was
this
monk
600
year
ago
run
oprah
s
book
club
and
he
didn
t
want
mccarthi
i
mean
aristotl
distribut
to
the
mass
becaus
they
weren
t

even
if
it
is
in
greek
the
book
had
the
abil
to
caus
chang
this
monk
this
librarian
didn
t
want
to
caus
