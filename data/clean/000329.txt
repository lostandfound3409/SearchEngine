at

in

he

i

the

whether

not
the

song
will
live
up
to
the
expect
was
it
qualiti
control
that
kept
them
from
releas
until
now
anoth
big
name
duet
for
jacko
was
mick
jagger
who
join
the
jackson
on
the
singl
“state
of
shock”
from
the
brother
‘victory’
album
in
1984
person
i
was
and
still
remain
underwhelm
by
that
song
other
element
of
posthum
twiddl
may
have
fare
well
but
for
me
the
qualiti
was
lack
with
the
beatl
“free
as
a
bird”
which
was
base
around
a
veri
basic
john
lennon
demo
record
but
let’
keep
finger
cross
that
this
stuff
is
actual
good
paul
gambaccini
has
suggest
that
the
song
were
dub
the
llama
record
given
that
jacko
alleg
brought
his
llama
into
the
studio
when
freddi
was
there
a
cautionari
note
was
sound
by
the
guardian’
laura
barton
who
said
“it
feel
like
we’r
suck
the
artists’
bone
dry…
sometim
it
would
be
nice
to
leav
them
with
a
littl
bit
of
digniti
”
i
think
i
can
agre
with
her
sentiment
there
but
i
obvious
won’t
pass
judgement
until
i
have
heard
the
song
the
releas
seem
like
to
be
later
this
year
so
while
you
wait
take
a
listen
to
some
classic
jacko
and
classic
queen
and
a
coupl
of
jacko
versus
queen
